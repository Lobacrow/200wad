When I have written about power weekends, I have usually referred to a weekend entirely devoted to personal development. It's usually a jam-packed Saturday and Sunday full of training, and by the end of the weekend, I am usually fired up and motivated to make things happen.

This weekend was a power weekend of a different sort. I worked a solid 18 hours over two days with a coworker. Instead of being fired up and motivated, I'm exhausted but satisfied with the progress.Â 

Our deliverable by the end of June is a business decision document that describes the scope of the project, the current state, current issues, proposed solutions, future state, and supporting analysis and documentation. It takes a lot of work to do the research, create and analyze SQL queries of data, and refine and summarize the information in a format that makes sense to the audience of stakeholders.

Nothing like a looming deadline of a work deliverable and vacation to kick start you into action. Something had to give this week, and of course, it wasn't going to be writing. I have plenty of ideas for podcast episodes, but I just don't have the energy to produce any right now. I will most likely not publish a full five episodes this week. Oh well, it's a holiday week and I don't hear anyone clamoring for more of them anyway. ?
