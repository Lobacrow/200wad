I pay a professional to prepare and file my taxes. It happens once a year, and I have no interest in the process. Why waste the time or energy on something that happens once a year?

Another example is an oil change. I know guys who insist on doing their own oil changes on their vehicles. Considering how little I drive, I get oil changes maybe twice a year. I have no interest in automobile maintenance, and for me, it is much more efficient to pay a professional.

Why spend a lot of time or effort on activities that don't occur very often? You should be focusing on activities that you do more frequently. 

If you do it every day, optimize it. 

What you do every day matters much more than what you do once a week or once a month or a few times a year. 

Start with the activities you are already doing (or should be doing) every day. Bathing. Brushing/flossing your teeth. Sleeping. Eating. Some type of physical activity. Writing (for those of us inclined). 

I would even go so far as to say #Startwithsleep because so many people are chronically sleep-deprived. If you do nothing else and only fix your sleep, you would be amazed how that unlocks so many other things for you.
