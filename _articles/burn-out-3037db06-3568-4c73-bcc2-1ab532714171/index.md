A co-worker returned to work today after being out for a week on vacation. Even though he was technically on PTO, he actually signed on periodically to check emails and even call in for meetings. According to him, this actually makes him less stressed out knowing what's going on. He said it allows him to enjoy vacation if he keeps tabs on things vs staying completely out of the loop and wondering what's happening.

I think this is the virtual equivalent of coming into the office on your day off. That's always been a pet peeve of mine. You're on PTO. Why come into the office?? And don't EVEN think about bringing kiddies with you to cause even more distractions.

I had a phone call with him today and said the following: "You know that feeling you have right now? You feel fully refreshed after a vacation...recharged..engines firing on all cylinders...full tank ready to hit the ground running to provide excellent service to the client? Yah, right now I have the exact opposite feeling."

I know I'm in burn-out mode. It's a good thing I'm taking some time off this week. I won't be checking in or wondering how things are going. I'm going to completely unplug from work, and I will be going out of town for a change of scenery.
