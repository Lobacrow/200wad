In 2006, Dos Equis beer launched a popular advertising campaign that lasted many years and launched a thousand memes. You probably remember The Most Interesting Man in the World portrayed by actor Jonathan Goldsmith. 

The ad campaign was clever. Here are some of my favorite quotes from The Most Interesting Man in the World:

*   When he drives a car off the lot, its price increases in value.
*   He once went to a psychic--to warn her.
*   If he were to punch you in the face you would have to fight off a strong urge to thank him.
*   He can speak Russian...in French.
*   Superman has pajamas with his logo.
*   He once brought a knife to a gunfight just to even the odds.
*   He once won a staring contest with his own reflection.
*   He can kill two stones with one bird.
*   His signature won a Pulitzer.
*   Sharks have a week dedicated to him.
*   He lives vicariously through himself.
*   He bowls overhand.
*   He once started a fire using only dental floss and water.
*   If opportunity knocks and he's not home, opportunity waits.
*   His pillow is cool on both sides.
*   He is the life of parties that he never attended.
*   He once scared Chuck Norris.

At the end of the commercials, he uttered his famous slogan "Stay Thirsty My Friends."

I have a couple of problems with this slogan. When he tells you to stay thirsty, he is encouraging you to remain in a constant state of dehydration. This suggestion flies in the face of all the health advice that recommends drinking lots of water to stay hydrated. The other problem is the suggestion that to quench said thirst, one should drink Dos Equis beer. 

As far as alcoholic beverages, beer ranks toward the bottom in terms of nutrition. One 12 oz bottle of Dos Equis beer has 131 calories, 0 fat, 11g carbs, and has 4.7% alcohol by volume. This beer is made with barley grains, hops, and yeast. With spirits, at least you are getting your ethanol unadulterated. Depending on the type of wine, you are getting some polyphenols and beneficial substances. Beer seems to only include an eventual beer gut.

I like the slogan "Stay Healthy My Friends" instead. This slogan implies that you first need to get healthy. Once you get healthy, you should stay healthy. That may not be the most interesting thing, but right now it's the best thing.
