In the consulting world, long-term engagements are few and far between. The vast majority of assignments are short-term (less than 1-2 years). Longer assignments are usually associated with a major implementation or conversion, but those end eventually as well.Â 

A traditional job offers at least the illusion of security and continued employment. But nothing is guaranteed.

I have a one year contract with my primary client that ends in June of 2021. My contract with the second client, which started in May, will last about another three months unless it is extended. For a fellow consultant working at the second client with me, it's his only assignment. He is somewhat nervous about not having a long-term assignment. The other day he said, "Oh to have a long-term steady job..." I replied, "Oh to NOT have a steady job to force one into pursuing the dream."

If our boss suddenly told us that he has a 3-year assignment for us, my coworker and I would have completely opposite reactions to the news. My coworker would be thrilled at the thought of a long-term assignment. I would be dreading it, feeling like I would be locked in. I think he is relatively happy working in the healthcare insurance industry, or he has at least accepted that this is going to be his career until he retires. I have not accepted it.

One person's safety net could be another person's chain of bondage.
