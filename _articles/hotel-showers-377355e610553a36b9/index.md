s, each one giving me a more puzzled look than the last one.

There are other issues not as critical but still annoying. Virtually all the rooms I stay in have a combined shower/tub. A tub with a slow drain combined with a high-pressure showerhead leads to an experience I call a "shath," which is a combined shower/bath. The

I have stayed in spectacular resorts, so I know what I am missing. But I am not paying for these stays, and I know my days in this field are numbered.

My hotel room this week has one of the "amenities" I described above. The bathroom has the feature (bug?) known as the combination shower/bath that I call a "shath." It starts when I turn the water on, which pours out of the faucet before I pull the lever to activate the showerhead. Even though the drain is open, the pressure of the water on the drain causes it to slowly close.

Several minutes into my shower, I realize that the water level is rising and not draining properly. My feet are taking a bath while the rest of me is taking a shower. This morning I had already started shampooing what's left of my hair, and I executed the daring maneuver to lean down through the shower spray to pull the drain open. I say daring because I've had shampoo get into my eyes and it is NOT a pleasant experience.

Some consultants on this project insist on staying in the same room each week and I understand why. I play hotel room roulette and sometimes I bust out. It could be worse. One consultant whose flight from Florida to California was delayed on Monday arrived in California after 9 PM only to discover his luggage was never put on his first flight. He called up a quick Uber to Target for a set of clothes and toiletries. The classic powder blue shirt/khaki pants combo never goes out of style..
