I actually got a headache reading CNET's [latest article](https://www.cnet.com/news/hbo-max-is-live-everything-to-know-discounts-free-trial-roku-launch-date-upgrades-prices-shows-movies/) describing the new streaming service HBO Max. When did streaming services get so complicated? 

All I wanted to know is do I have access to this new service if I already have HBO Go? I lost patience with the article, so I went to the iPad to launch HBO Go and it magically turned into HBO Max. I guess that answers that question.

I guess HBO Max has all the same content from the previous HBO offering plus more. I see _Friends_,  _The Big Bang Theory,_ and _Rick and Morty_, which appear to be part of the new content. I also see "Max Originals" such as _Looney Tunes_ cartoons and _The Not-Too-Late Show with Elmo_. Obviously, this is a swipe to grab viewers away from Disney+. 

There is nothing blowing me away about this new offering from HBO. I understand HBO may not have another Game of Thrones up its sleeve, but shouldn't they have some big-ticket item at launch? Is Tickle-Me Elmo the best they have?? I was thinking of canceling the HBO Go service, and I'm not sure any of this "new" content is enough to keep me long term.
