I lasted four weeks working out three days a week before I hit a wall. Last weekend I burned out both mentally and physically. After some reflection, I want to assess what I think happened and how I shall move forward.

**I started out too aggressively.** I asked my flex coach for a basic, total-body workout.  The problem is that her version of a basic workout was still too advanced for someone who has gone so long without any type of physical activity or training. 

**I am someone who has 2-day delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS).** The basic structure of a workout schedule allows for rest days in between workouts. My problem is that I'm prone to more soreness on the second day after a workout, which was supposed to be the day of the next work out. That type of schedule is not going to work for me.

**I underestimated how much a 2nd gig would drain me.** At the beginning of May, I started with a second client. I only committed to 8-10 hours per week, but I underestimated how that extra assignment would affect me mentally and physically. It feels different from the last time I had two assignments four years ago.

I find it interesting that I was able to sustain dietary changes much longer than a physical workout regimen. This is a tough one for me. I don't get the "high" or "rush" that people claim to get from physical activity. It's brutal work that leads to pain and soreness for me, and I only do it because I know it's good for me not because I enjoy it. I don't think I will ever enjoy it, and somehow I need to figure out how to reconcile that feeling with the overall pursuit of better health.

For now, Project Strength has been paused for me to figure out a better approach that is more sustainable.
