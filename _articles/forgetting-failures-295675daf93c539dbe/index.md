Jack Nicklaus is considered one of the greatest professional golfers of all time. He holds the record of 18 major championships, three more than Tiger Woods. He is a true champion.

Jack gave a speech and said that he never missed a 3-foot putt and never 3-putted on the final hole of a tournament. 

In the Q&A section at the end of the speech, someone in the audience said, "Mr. Nicklaus, with all due respect, you _have_ done both of those."

Nicklaus replied, "Sir, you are mistaken..."

After the event, the same man walked up to Dr. Bob Rotella the famous sports psychologist who was appearing with Jack. 

"Dr. Rotella, you know and I know that Jack has missed a 3-foot putt in a tournament..."

"Young man, Jack came to share with you how he thinks, not learn how you think. Jack sees no benefit to reliving a missed put. He doesn't feed his mind with thoughts of mistakes."

Jack was not kidding when he said he never missed a 3-foot putt. He truly believes it because he focused on his successes and forgot about his failures.

Disappointment is a temporary emotion, not a permanent perspective. You can't afford the luxury of negative thoughts. 

What are you focusing on?
