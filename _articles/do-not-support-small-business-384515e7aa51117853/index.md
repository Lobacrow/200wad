In these crazy times, the one thing you definitely do NOT want to do is support small business. You can be relying on a small business and you turn around and the next thing you know they are closed or out of business! Then what are you going to do? Here you were trying to "do the right thing," and you end up getting screwed.Â 

Now the big guys...Walmart, Target, Amazon...they'll always be around. You can count on them, and they won't leave you high and dry like some small business.

A friend of mine refers to examples like this that as my "contrarian humor." It's how I have been entertaining myself to inject some levity among all the dire news stories.

I also used to espouse a contrarian viewpoint of washing hands. I told people, "I wash my hands _before_ I go to the restroom not after. Because who knows where these hands have been. If I'm about to handle the crown jewels, I want to make sure my hands are completely clean. Then, no need to wash hands after because I just washed them. Who knew we'd reach a point where washing hands is a must before AND after!
