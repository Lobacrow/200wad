The other day I joined a webinar and was greeted with a notice to download something called Microsoft Teams. Now we have yet another messaging and meeting program. Do we really need another one?

We already have Skype, Instant Message, Slack, WhatsApp, WebEx, Go To Meeting, Join Me, something called Jabber, and now we are adding Microsoft Teams. On one of my client's laptops, Microsoft Teams just showed up one day. It automatically launched when I logged in, and I was blasted with the message, "Enjoy using Teams!" Now, I didn't ask for this new program. It was installed without my approval, and now I have the edict to not only use it but enjoy it as well!

I realize with many people working remotely that these programs are necessary. You can't just walk down the hallway to ask a question or bump into someone in the break room or fart in someone else's cubicle. We need messaging and meeting programs, but can we stick to just one and not abuse them? One of my clients has three different programs, and I get random messages on each one all day. 

Or how about when someone sends you an email and three seconds later he or she sends you a message. "Hey, I just sent you an email." My reply is, "Great! I look forward to reading it next Tuesday." I stay on top of priority emails, but I'm usually a week behind with all the rest of them.

I know people thought that this new way of working would be temporary, but I say settle in folks. This is going to last a lot longer than we all imagined. It's time to think about a new way of operating where we aren't on the horn or flooded with messages and emails all day.
