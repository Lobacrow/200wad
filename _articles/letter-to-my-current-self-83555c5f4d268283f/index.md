Forget the letter to my younger self. I need to communicate to myself in the present day and hopefully to my future self who will return to this post for reminders.

You will lose enthusiasm. You can get it back.

You will lose motivation. You can get it back.

You will sometimes be in a funk and you don't know why. It will pass.

Each day is a new day. It doesn't matter how the last few days went. What matters is what you do today.Â 

You are going to have to do a lot of things that you don't feel like doing. Do them anyway. This is the price to pay to reach your dreams.

Stop creating excuses and playing mind games with yourself. You know what you need to do. Just do it.

Be patient and don't expect change overnight.

Stop saying to yourself, "This is just the way I am" and start asking, "Whom do I want to be?"

Don't try to fix what isn't broken, which you are using as a distraction from doing the real work to improve yourself.

Forgive yourself for making mistakes and learn from them.

Be open to new ideas and new experiences.

Celebrate the wins.

Never quit.
