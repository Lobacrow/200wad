[As I wrote about previously](https://cowriters.app/words/project-food-as-fuel-what-s-next-425675f050ddc3bd9e), I am crafting what will be my long-term diet using a variety of sources. 

First up is the specific food guide provided by Virta Health Clinic that I used as part of a ketogenic diet. This is the basic low-carb framework that will serve as a guide, but there are many foods that won't make it because I don't like them (looking at you green beans) and foods I will add that might be higher on the spectrum of carbs. I will generally apply a low-carb approach without strict maintenance of ketosis.
