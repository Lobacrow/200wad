When I was a kid I had lots of dreams. Big and crazy dreams. Dreams about being like Superman and flying around in the sky. Or like Spiderman slinging webs and swinging from building to building. Or like Luke Skywalker and piloting a spacecraft across the galaxy. 

As I got a bit older the dreams shifted from the fantastical to the realistic, but they nevertheless remained big. I dreamed about traveling the world and seeing the great wonders and meeting new people. I dreamed about being famous and having people seek me out to help them. I dreamed about having so much money that I could take care of my family and give to charities or start my own to make a difference in the world. (Okay maybe that's what I hope I was dreaming. Let's be honest. I wanted to get rich to have a nice life and date hot chicks.)

Then I got older and something called "reality" kicked in. There's these pesky bills and responsibilities that showed up that were nowhere to be found when I was a kid. Over time the big dreams shrank to match the new reality. This happens to a lot of people. What happened to all the big dreams and the great things I wanted to do? 

Lose weight. Pay off my house. Save money for retirement. Come on is this the best I can do??

I've been working on a Dream Board and the sky is the limit. I want to be scared and excited by these new dreams.

It's time to dream big again. Won't you join me?
