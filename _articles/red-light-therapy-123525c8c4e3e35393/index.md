I am always looking at techniques and devices to biohack myself and improve health. One of my recent experiments has been with red light therapy.

Here are some of the beneficial effects of light therapy:

*   Increased collagen production  
    
*   Reduced joint pain and inflammation
*   Improved sleep
*   Enhanced weight loss
*   Faster muscle recovery
*   Better physical performance

I purchased a device from a company called [Joovv](https://joovv.com). The company's newest product is a small device designed for travel. This product can be ordered for red light or near-infrared light (NIR), and each one has different effects on the body. I chose the red light specifically for the purported benefit to sleep.

I have been using the device once a day in the evening for a week. I can safely say that I've already experienced improved sleep. My sleep is generally worse in hotel rooms than at home. This last week I had some of the best sleep I have had in hotels. Using my Oura ring, I determined that my deep sleep has increased and awakenings during the night have decreased. 

The device I have is the Joovv Go, which is really only big enough to cover my face in one treatment. I am considering pulling the trigger on a larger device to enable more whole-body treatment to see if I experience the additional benefits. 

I am a believer in the science of light therapy, and I am glad a company like Joovv is helping bring professional-grade products to consumers who are able to take advantage of them.
