Here we go again. Every time I turn around, there is another company offering its own streaming service with exclusive content. 

Disney + is live with all the expected Disney properties including the Pixar movies, the Marvel Universe, as well as Star Wars. The price isn't bad at $7/month. For anyone with kiddies, it would seem to be a no-brainer.

I had no plans to sign up for the new service. I have plenty of content with Netflix and Amazon Prime (and that lingering HBO GO subscription that I didn't cancel after GoT). But then I found out that if you have a certain Verizon plan, you can get one year of Disney+ for free. Bing bang boom and I'm signed on like ten million other people. 

Of course, I went straight to the new live-action _Star Wars_ series _The Mandalorian_. Even though the _Star Wars_ franchise has lost its way many times (what I call the Jar Jar Effect), I am still a sucker when it's done well. The first episode was like a mini-movie and gave me enough to want more.

I've got a year to poke around and catch anything else good before I pull the plug. Plenty of time.
