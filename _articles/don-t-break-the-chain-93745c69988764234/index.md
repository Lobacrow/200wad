This [article](https://lifehacker.com/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret-281626) explains a productivity secret from Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry said he realized that in order to be a better comic he needed to create better jokes. The way to create better jokes was to write every day. To accomplish this, Jerry used a simple calendar system.

He got a big wall calendar with the whole year on one page and hung it on the wall where he would see it everyday. Then he got a big red magic marker. For every day that he completed his writing task, he put a big red X over that day. Here is the most important part:

> After a few days you'll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You'll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain.

Daily action builds habits. Think of it as the [1% Rule](https://200wordsaday.com/words/the-1-rule-for-creating-all-habits-91495c672c4f4bfc4). This explains the beauty of 200WAD. People who are writing a book like @basilesamel know that writing a bit each day and every day over time will create much better results compared to sitting down one or two days a week to cram in a bunch of thoughts.

Maybe it's a calendar and a big red magic marker that will do the trick like it did for Seinfeld. Maybe it's a checklist on your phone. Maybe it's the fire icon of the streak on 200WAD (my personal favorite). Whatever tool you need to hold yourself accountable, find what works for you and use it.

Some people ask which is harder, taking that first step or keeping it going after the first step. Who cares. The point is to start.Â 

And don't break the chain.
