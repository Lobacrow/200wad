I have so many ideas to write about from my training event.

The Director of Training Marc Accetta illustrated that there are four levels of learning. 

1\. **Unconsciously incompetent** - This is where all newbies start. When you start learning something you don’t know anything and you are terrible at the task. 

2\. **Consciously incompetent** - Once you get trained or learn the ropes, now you have the knowledge of what to do. You are still terrible at the task because you don’t have enough experience. The way to get to the next level is to put in the time.  Malcolm Gladwell says to be an expert you need to devote at least 10,000 hours to practice.

3\. **Consciously competent** - This is where most people want to be and then they stop. They are good at the task but it still requires focus. 

4\. **Unconsciously competent** - This is the highest level of learning when you become a master and the task has become so ingrained that it’s automatic. Think driving a car after many years on the road. 

Why do I care about #Teamstreak so much? It’s about putting in the time over and over again. Repetition is the key. Shots on goal. Not every piece is a masterpiece. So what. Keep your head down and keep putting in the work, and one day you’ll look up and see how far you’ve come.

We are #Teamstreak!!
