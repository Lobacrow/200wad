As I [wrote about a week ago](https://cowriters.app/words/the-brandonian-doctrine-388845e88ad1ae9240), I launched a podcast. I refer to it as a micro podcast because the episodes are very short (under 2 minutes). A friend of mine referred to it as a bit cast. I like the sound of that. Short episodes are easy to crank out, which lets me publish one per day. Short episodes lower the barrier to entry, and the Anchor app makes the technical pieces simple and straightforward even for a non-techie like me.

Since I started publishing episodes, I began thinking of new ideas in the context of whether they would be better as a podcast episode or written article. Audio is different because it is a performance. I'm not going to just deliver the words in a monotone voice. I want it to be fun while I'm doing it, and I want to be entertained by it afterward.

I'm not trying to make money, although there are some monetization features of the Anchor platform. I'm not trying to educate people on the benefits of sleep or lecture them about how to be healthier. I'm just trying to make myself laugh, and if a few other people get some chuckles then it's all the better. We can all use a good laugh now and then.
