I was wide awake a full hour and a half earlier than my anticipated wake-up time. There is no set it and forget it with sleep. You can do all the right things and still end up with issues. As I like to say, every once in awhile the lion gets out of its cage.

According to the Oura ring, I had 6h 14m of sleep, with REM and deep sleep each taking about 25% of that time. My sleep score was 77 (85 is the cut-off for a solid night of sleep.)

I woke up alert with mind racing. It's no surprise that my thoughts revolve around work. That's usually the case when I become early birdy. There's no point in trying to go back to sleep. I know it's not going to happen. 

I haven't figured it all out about sleep. 

_collective gasp from the audience_ "What!? You're supposed to be the expert if you are writing a book about it!" 

I guess that is the common wisdom about someone writing a non-fiction book. "Well, he wrote the book on it!" 

I'm just some dude. I figured out how to improve my sleep, but I'm no expert. I think you'll like the book anyway.
