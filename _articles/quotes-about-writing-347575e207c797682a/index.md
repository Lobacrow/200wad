I like a good quote. It's even better if the person to whom the quote is attributed is recognizable. Now, that shouldn't matter if it's a really good quote. But, I admit I have seen quotes I liked and then saw it was a no-name person (or worse yet a [Non Name](https://medium.com/@brandonwilson_84606/a-news-filter-the-list-of-non-names-a9e4cbd7a03e)) and thought, I guess I'll pass on that one. Meaning, I paused for a brief moment to ponder the quote but did not pass it on to anyone else or make a note of it. What a shame. I should have researched that person to figure out who came up with such a great quote.

I came across a list of writing quotes and a few stood out to me

> Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing. --Benjamin Franklin

> 90 percent perfect and shared with the world always changes more lives than 100 percent perfect and stuck in your head. --Jon Acuff

> You don't write because you want to say something, you write because you have something to say. --F. Scott Fitzgerald
