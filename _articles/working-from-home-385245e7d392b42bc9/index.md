So many people who are not used to working from home have been doing so lately. I can tell based on the conference calls in which new team members such as barking dogs and crying babies join in.

I was working at home long before it became fashionable (and necessary). @keni suggested that I write a guide for working at home. I thought about it, but the topic doesn't really interest me.

I recently read a [post on Smart Blogger](https://smartblogger.com/working-from-home/) with tools and tips about working from home. I will just provide my thoughts and insights on some of the ideas in this article.

*   Dedicated workspace - I strongly agree with this. Whether it's a separate room or a separate corner, working wherever you plop down with your laptop is not optimal.
*   Headphones - Definitely a must for conference calls and to drown out background noise.
*   No Chromebook - I was never a fan of Chromebook anyway.
*   Strong Wi-Fi - This is a must-have, although my trick on this one is that I'm hardwired to the modem with an ethernet cable to avoid any issues with Wi-Fi.
*   A dual monitor \- Yet another must-have in my book, but I know some people get by with one large, wide-screen monitor. In general, an external monitor is preferable. You should generally NOT work long-term on a laptop for a variety of reasons. For many months I worked on a laptop in a conference room, and long story short I ended up with a frozen shoulder. Without question, you need to make sure your set-up is conducive to proper ergonomics with good eye level with monitor and keyboard and mouse at the right level.
*   Standing desk - I have the Vari-Desk, but I am unable to use it at the moment because the keyboard tray attached to the desk broke, and I had to reorganize my layout. When I get a new desk, I will be using the Vari-Desk more. I can't say I used it much previously. Standing can be just as bad as sitting. The problem is not moving.

There are some good tips in the tip section. There is one I have never understood. You will hear some people say to keep your same morning routine. Shower and dress as if you are going to work. I don't know who is doing this because absolutely no one I know who works at home does this.
