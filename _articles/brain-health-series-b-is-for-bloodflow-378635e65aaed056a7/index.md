The [new book I'm reading](https://cowriters.app/words/the-end-of-mental-illness-378135e63c2aab49f9) has inspired me to start a new collection devoted to Brain Health. Remember, knowledge is not power. I need to take the knowledge and put it into action. The first step is capturing the information I'm learning and transforming it into actions and habits in my own life.

This collection is based on Daniel Amen, MD's BRIGHT MINDS model:

B is for Blood Flow

R is for Retirement and Aging

I is for Inflammation

G is for Genetics

H is for Head Trauma

T is for Toxins

M is for Mind Storms

I is for Immunity and Infections

N is for Neurohormone Issues

D is for Diabesity

S is for Sleep

The number one strategy to support your brain and mental health is to protect, nurture, and optimize your heart and blood vessels. Anything that damages your blood vessels damages your mind.

**My Action Steps**

*   Limit caffeinated drinks to 1-2 per day. More than two cups of caffeinated drinks per day constrict blood flow to the brain.
*   Limit alcohol. This is an easy one as I rarely drink alcohol primarily for health reasons.Â 
*   Avoid nicotine. Another easy one--I don't smoke. Nicotine constricts blood flow to the brain.
*   Continue to monitor blood pressure daily. I do this primarily because I was on blood pressure medicine for many years, and now I no longer take it and want to make sure my blood pressure remains in the normal range (ideally at or below 120/80).
*   Always drink more water to stay hydrated.
*   Spend 10 minutes per day in meditation. I've built this habit with the Muse headset that makes it easy to assess each session and track my progress.
*   Incorporate regular physical exercise into my lifestyle. This is the toughest one on the list and even more difficult due to my travel schedule. I have a stretch appointment once a week. I ride a bike and use a whole-body vibration machine when I'm home. I recently purchased a trampoline to combine strength training and cardio. I use resistance bands and standard exercises I can do in my hotel room. I don't count my steps, but I have a goal to get at least a 30-minute walk every day.
*   Supplements--I won't list all the supplements I'm currently taking, but as I rotate off certain ones, I will add in some of the recommended supplements with research-based evidence to help maintain healthy blood pressure and increase blood flow: Ginkgo biloba, cocoa flavanols (Did someone say dark chocolate?? Sugar-free, of course), omega-3 fatty acids, green tea catechins, and resveratrol.
