Joe Rogan has a bit that polls are all BS because think about the people who actually answer polls. He says most people don't have the time or want to deal with answering questions, so the data gleaned from polls aren't representative of the population at large. Regardless of the reason, we now have pretty strong evidence from 2016 and now 2020 that something is wrong with polling.

I've always been against polls that are taken several months or even a year out from the election. "We asked, if the election were held today..." So what? The election is not being held today. What value does the answer provide us one year out from the election? Or those dubious polls of one specific candidate vs. "generic candidate from the other side." Again, useless.

There is now the concept that polling data are being weaponized prior to the election. After all, if you believe the polls are accurate and you see what the expected outcome is, this may influence your vote or even whether you vote.

We need to demand better information from the companies that have the big megaphones shouting it at us. We need accountability for the firms that were way off in projections and reward the firms that were spot-on or very close.
