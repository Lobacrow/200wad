In the business of consulting, when a project ends or when our contract ends, we call it rolling off the project. I like to refer to anyone rolling off as "Boris Rolloff." 

Since I'm in a role as manager, I have a hand in evaluating resources. Of course, I want my company to have more business, but if the client determines that someone has to go, that's what needs to be done. 

I shouldn't have been surprised that this was coming. As soon as the client hires a full-time resource, it should be expected that we would eliminate a consultant position. This assumes the amount of work stays the same, which it never does. Even though I presented a fair case for keeping all current resources, this was not the way it would go.

I had a 1-1 with a consultant today, and we discussed the need to have him roll off the project at the end of November. This was not the original plan as all the consultants on this project had contracts through June of next year. At least we have some advance notice to prepare for the transition. 

Fortunately, it looks like we may have another project lined up for Boris to start on as soon as he is finished with my client.
