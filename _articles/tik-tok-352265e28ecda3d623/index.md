If given the opportunity to return to any point in my past, I guess I would pick four days ago before I downloaded some app called Tik Tok. I had heard of this app, and I know it's big with the kiddies. I went through the rabbit hole on Monday, and now I wonder whether I can escape.

If I launch the app, twenty minutes can go by like a snap of the fingers. The endless content in the form of short videos, one after the other, is mesmerizing and very addictive. There is also the added bonus that much of the content plays to my puerile sense of humor typified by the following phrase: Farts will always be funny.

I could uninstall the app, but I'm going to keep it (on the last page of my apps). I will test my powers of discipline and self-control.

Okay, I just wasted fifteen minutes looking for a video to link here and suck you in.  No. I can't do that. Must resist. 

Wow, there's one I really want to post. I just wasted another ten minutes.

Nope. I will save you from the abyss. 

Testing self-control indeed.
