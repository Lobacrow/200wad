Neurotransmitters are signaling chemicals that are critical for brain function and the communication between the brain and the body. It is helpful to understand major neurotransmitters and how being dominant or deficient in certain neurotransmitters can influence your daily life and overall health.

Of the many neurotransmitters, there are four that are most common:

**Dopamine** - In the brain, dopamine is the primary motivating chemical sometimes referred to as the pleasure chemical. It can promote ambition, drive, and action.

**Seratonin** - In the brain, seratonin is a natural antidepressant and controls sleep, appetite, and body temperature. About 90% of the body’s serotonin is used in the gastrointestinal tract and is responsible for regulating movement of food through the digestive system along with bowel movements.

**Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)** - In the brain, GABA helps you relax and calm down. In the digestive system, GABA mainly stimulates movement of food through the gastrointestinal system and digestion.

**Acetylcholine** - In the brain, acetylcholine promotes focus, memory, and cognition as well as motor neurons associated with muscle movement. In the digestive system, acetylcholine stimulates smooth muscle contractions that help move food through the gastrointestinal  system.

In the same way that we tend to have dominant personality traits, we also tend to have neurotransmitter dominance.

**Dopamine dominance** - You are likely strong-willed, fast on your feet, can be hyperactive, and are self-confident. A dopamine deficiency can lead to fatigue, feeling sluggish, memory loss, or depression.

**Seratonin dominance** - You are highly responsive to sensory input. You like to try new things and explore new places. You are also drawn to exciting activities. A seratonin deficiency can make you feel tired or out of control.

**GABA dominance** \- You tend to be very calm and level-headed in stressful situations. You like organization, planning, stability, and are slow to anger. A GABA deficiency can make you feel nervous, anxious, or irritable.

**Acetylcholine dominance** \- You are highly creative, optimistic, and tend toward artistic pursuits. You also tend to be very social and open to new ideas. An acetylcholine deficiency can result in poor memory, slow reactions to stimuli, and overall brain feeling slow.

So, how do you find out your neurotransmitter dominance and whether you may have a deficiency? One tool is a free online test at [www.bravermantest.com](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bravermantest.com%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0L0DRehdB9O2-32bHL4JCPZ1ZrJTLnNfjkPPq0mTANHKdDH4m6RcEwxUo&h=AT2ljDSor82Qbmnp5yjZfJpuNyt6K91uZjLJBXqw40kFCiSxVJhQRWBnBAyJ0R7lYOkuOc97KiVRVYk6BNbKwAFHatoLyBCE8o2fyPeNSW71XHPuR2URaUUsb2H5EyItGDTFOnAd) that uses a series of personality questions to determine your neurotransmitter dominance and possible deficiencies including nutrient recommendations. This test offers much more detail beyond the high-level descriptions above.
