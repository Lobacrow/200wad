Your title is the most important marketing decision you'll make. It is the thing that defines your book.

The first piece of information anyone gets about your book is the title. You don't have to lock in your title right now, but you need a working title. Even a bad title helps you find a good title, but no title keeps you stuck. 

Sub-titles can be just a description of the book. 

By the way, you cannot copyright titles. You can trademark a title if it is part of a larger brand, e.g., _The Bulletproof Diet_. 

The 5 Attributes of a good book title:

1\. Attention Grabbing

2\. Memorable & Searchable

3\. Informative (gives an idea of what the book is about)

4\. Easy & not embarrassing to say

5\. Short

There is a lot more to cover with book titles, but I don't want to get bogged down in selecting a title. For now I am going to set my working title: 

Start With Sleep

_Tips and strategies to improve your sleep for more energy, increased focus, and overall better health_
