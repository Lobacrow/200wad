This next movie is a comedy from 1986 that stars one of the all-time great comedians: Rodney Dangerfield. The movie is _Back to School._ Rodney plays a character named Thornton Melon, a wealthy but uneducated father who decides to go to college to show solidarity with his son. Hilarity ensues as Thornton goes to class, remodels the dorm rooms, crashes a sorority house, and parties like an animal.

The film features a [memorable exchange](https://youtu.be/k9DO26O6dIg) between Rodney and another legendary comedian Sam Kinison, who plays a history teacher named Professor Turgeson. For those of you who don't know Sam Kinison, he was a Pentecostal preacher who became one of the raunchiest, vulgar, and celebrated comedians of all time.

Here is one of my favorite jokes that Rodney delivers while he is in a hot tub with a coed named Bubbles.

Thornton Melon: What's your favorite subject?

Bubbles: Poetry

Thornton Melon: Really? Well, maybe you can help me straighten out my Longfellow. 

The movie also features Mr. Tony Stark himself, Robert Downey Jr. 

I read an interview with Rodney in which he indicated that he doesn't like making movies because no one laughs when he delivers the lines. Comedians are all about the laughs. Well, I hope Rodney knows he got lots of laughs with this one. RIP Rodney Dangerfield 1921-2004
