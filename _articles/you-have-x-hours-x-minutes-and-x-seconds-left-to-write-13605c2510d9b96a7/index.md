For some reason when I pull up the website for a split second I just see X's instead of the amount of time left. For that split second I have a mild sense of panic as I get closer to the deadline. Usually I complete my daily writing well before the deadline, which happens to be later afternoon my time. Still, it's nice to know how much time is left.

I guess this shows the power of a streak for me. It provides a sense of accomplishment to see the number go up every day and know that my commitment has been fulfilled for that period of time. I suppose at some point I won't necessarily "need" the streak anymore when the habit is fully formed, but it is nice to have now.

I wonder what other areas of my life I can apply a "streak mentality" to get results. Maybe walking a certain number of steps per day. Or guaranteeing a minimum number of hours of sleep every night. The great thing about tracking a streak is that it gains more power the longer it goes. I suppose at some point it may become more about the streak than the actual activity. But for now I am grateful for small things like tracking daily accomplishments.
