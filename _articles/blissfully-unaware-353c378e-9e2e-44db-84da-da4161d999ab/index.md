I had a productive day of work today. It kept me occupied and blissfully unaware of all the news (noise) swirling around election day in the US.

After 700 days of writing every day, I can officially say that writing has become a super power for me. Today, I completed a 13-page document template in about three hours. It would have probably taken a day or more without all my practice. I can probably count on one hand the number of work colleagues who are competent writers, and none of them can come close to my productivity and quality. I suppose that sounds like bragging, but my point is that you should get good at things worth getting good at.Â 

I made a decision a long time ago that I wanted to be a better writer and perhaps make a career out of it. Writers write everyday, so that's what I have been doing. It's paid off. I wonder how far I can take this thing. I still look at my writing and say it's not good enough. I will continue to strive toward improvement and not compete with anyone else but only with the person I was yesterday.
