This afternoon I walked over to the Dutch Bros coffee shop for a cup of joe. As I was walking back to my house, I got cornered by two young men on bicycles with the telltale white shirts and ties. In the area where I live, I like to say I'm hiding among the Mormons, as there is a rather large Mormon population in this area of Arizona. 

I stayed to chat for a bit. They were nice guys and actually very good at what they do. In fact, had I not known their purpose I would have thought they were in the network marketing business. 

Believe it or not, I think I provided more value to them than they provided to me. I have talked to Mormons before, so I have a rough idea of what the religion is about. I suppose I could learn more. 

At the end of our discussion, I was gifted with a Book of Mormon. I've always wondered if the Bible is the end-all-be-all scripture, why do we need the book of Mormon? Apparently, this very question is answered in the introduction. I could have waited to hear their answer, but I was ready to get back to the A/C.

So now I have another book to add to the pile. More [Tsundoku](https://200wordsaday.com/words/engaging-in-tsundoku-199895d00cf60bc39a).
