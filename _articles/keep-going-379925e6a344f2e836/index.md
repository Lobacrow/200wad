I could have used the title "Don't stop." What's the difference between "don't stop" and "keep going?"

Focus.

If I tell you do NOT picture a giraffe, you are going to picture a giraffe. But I told you DON'T do that. It doesn't matter.

  

If you are on the wrong path, change course and keep going.

If you are on the right path, keep going.Â 

If it feels like you are not making any progress, keep going.

If no one encourages you on your journey, keep going.

If you are worried about what other people think of you, keep going.  

If you are worried about what you think of yourself, keep going.

If it feels like it's never going to get any easier, keep going.

If it seems like you are never going to reach your goal, keep going.

If you are tired and don't have the energy, keep going.

If you are scared of making a mistake, keep going.

If you want to achieve the greatness you are meant for, keep going.

  

I can't believe I'm going to quote a Miley Cyrus song from Hannah Montana: The Movie. What can I say, this song really says it all.

I can almost see it

That dream I'm dreamin'

But there's a voice inside my head saying

You'll never reach it

Every step I'm taking

Every move I make

Feels lost with no direction

My faith is shaken

But I

I gotta keep tryin'

Gotta keep my head held high

There's always gonna be another mountain

I'm always gonna wanna make it move

Always gonna be an uphill battle

Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose

Ain't about how fast I get there

Ain't about what's waiting on the other side

It's the climb

For the people who have joined me on this journey so far, thank you for reading. For the people who haven't joined me yet, thank you too because that means I still have more work to do.

Keep going.

I'm reminded of a quote:

> A year from now you'll wish you had started today.

A year ago I had reached 100 days of writing. I'm glad I kept going. I'm glad the members of #Teamstreak have kept going:

@basilesamel

@knight

@jasonleow

@arcticloon

@keni

@efran

@hum

@phaidenbauer

@rolandocvargas

@haideralmosawi

@peterdannock

If you're a member of #Teamstreak, I'm watching what you're doing. Even though I don't comment on every post, I read many of them. I also notice those who leave the team and the ones who rejoin.

Every day can't be a bed of roses. There are crazy things going on in the world. There are days when I reach the end of the day and haven't written anything. Do I think to myself, "Ahh just give yourself a break. You don't _have_ to write every day." Absolutely not. It would be easier to let myself slide if I were just writing for myself without the public accountability offered by writing here. But I can't let the team (and by extension myself) down.

We share some of the same reasons for writing, but we all have our own unique "whys" for doing what we're doing. Despite different backgrounds and locations, we all show up in the same place every day. It is a gratifying feeling to know that I'm not alone.

Thank you for showing up every day. It matters more than you may realize.

And most definitely, keep going.
