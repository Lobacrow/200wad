No, I'm not referring to the great [1986 comedy _Back to School_](https://200wordsaday.com/words/favorite-movies-6-328095df54056ca252) starring Rodney Dangerfield.

I have completed Unit 1 of my nutrition course. Here is a list of the chapter titles to give you an idea of the content so far:

Chapter 1: Introduction

Chapter 2: Your learning plan

Chapter 3: What is a great coach?

Chapter 4: Helping people change

Chapter 5: What is good nutrition?

Notice how virtually none of the content in Unit 1 is about nutrition proper. Fast-forward to Unit 2 and now things are getting real.

Chapter 6: Introduction to nutritional science

Chapter 7: Systems and cells

Now it's getting REAL. I took biology I in high school and that was it. Biology was not interesting, and I would have had to slog through multiple biology courses before I was allowed to take human anatomy and physiology. I was much more interested in chemistry and physics, which actually made me think and made use of my mathematical abilities rather than just memorization.

Nowadays I am interested in nutrition, so I have to go through biology to get there. At least this time I am learning because I want to learn and this is a means to an end. Time to go back to school.
