Every Monday, I conduct my team meeting. It's a [MEATY meeting](https://medium.com/the-ascent/28-of-the-most-annoying-things-about-meetings-and-how-to-make-meetings-meaty-f79a70d77f2d), so of course, there is an agenda that I send out prior to the meeting, and I capture notes during the meeting and send them after the meeting. Things can get boring when it's all about work. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. A few weeks ago, I decided to add a segment at the end of the meeting for trivia to spice things up a bit and introduce some fun.

The hardest task I complete on Mondays is coming up with trivia questions. It's not as easy as you think! There's really a science to it. I have loved trivia ever since I was a kid, and I owe that primarily to the TV show _Jeopardy!_

Yesterday, I was deeply saddened to hear that Alex Trebek had finally died after a long battle with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer. I added a tribute to him in today's [Be Wellthy newsletter](https://bewellthy.substack.com/p/on-sleep-being-gruntled-and-love).Â 

I suppose I can't tease trivia without giving you at least one question that I'll be using today. What is the longest-running US game show still on the air? Hint: It's not _Jeopardy!_
