I finally relented and watched the Netflix documentary _The Game Changers_. It clearly has high production values with a good storyline, celebrity appearances, and the illusion of being scientific. If you haven't seen the documentary, I'll save you the time by providing the thesis: Everyone should stop eating red meat and animal products and switch to a plant-based diet for improved health, longevity, physical performance, and recovery. According to the documentary, the switch will also lead to a healthier planet and help combat climate change.

If you have seen _The Game Changers_, I would suggest referencing  #1389 [Joe Rogan's podcast interview with functional medicine clinician Chris Kesser](https://youtu.be/Dq4Apc2Xk7Q). I would also like to point you to an [article](https://chriskresser.com/debunking-the-game-changers-joe-rogan/) in which Chris details whether the scientific literature supports or contradicts information presented in the documentary.

The lesson here is that when you are dealing with such an important topic such as health and nutrition, you need to become informed. Watching one documentary or reading one article is not sufficient for making critical decisions about your health.

My Project Food As Fuel is all about reversing diabetes and improving my health using a medically-supervised ketogenic diet. Does this mean the keto diet is right for everyone? Of course not. 

What is the best diet? No matter what you see, hear, or read, there is no one best diet that is suitable for everyone. Sorry, I wish there was a magical solution that takes the guesswork out of it. There are, however, basic principles about nutrition based on scientific research that should be part of any diet you choose.

What is good nutrition?
-----------------------

The healthiest people in the world do not have a single nutrition philosophy. You can find examples of certain cultures that have thrived on high-fat diets with few vegetables as well as low-fat diets with lots of vegetables and starchy carbohydrates. In fact, if you compare the Blue Zones, areas in the world where people live exceptionally long and healthy lives, you will find the diets to be quite varied based on geographic areas and cultures. 

> The human body adapts very well to many different ways of eating.

The best diet for you is one that supports your health and activity goals that you can consistently follow and is supported by the foundation of good nutrition.

**Good nutrition is a science, not a belief system.** It should be based on the best available scientific evidence and updated as better evidence becomes available. 

**Good nutrition controls energy balance.** Too little energy from food and the body starts shutting down non-critical processes. Too much energy from food and the body will store excess fat and may have hormonal imbalances and increased inflammation that lead to many chronic diseases. 

**Good nutrition gives us nutrients.** In addition to the energy we get from food measured by calories, we also get nutrients. Each food has a certain nutrient density, and you feel the best and your body performs the best when it gets the right nutrients. 

**Good nutrition helps us look, feel, and perform our best.** Whether it's reversing a disease, wanting more energy, wanting clothes to fit better, or wanting to increase athletic performance, nutrition is the foundation. 

**Good nutrition is sustainable.** I'm the first to admit I have tried many "yo-yo" diets with short-term success followed by a return to my previous condition or even worse off. While you might focus on short-term goals, overall nutrition should be focused on what can be sustained for the long haul. This applies not only to what you can consistently apply but also to what the planet can sustain in terms of providing quality food for an ever-increasing population.

**Good nutrition asks people to be aware of their food and eating.** Eating can be so automatic. We do it without even thinking, and this is certainly where I have gotten into trouble. Research shows the actual choices about what you eat are probably less important than _paying better attention when you eat_.

**Good nutrition promotes regular movement.** Our bodies are designed to move. It's one thing to put good nutrition into the system, but physical activity allows the body to make the best use of those nutrients. 

**Good nutrition is outcome-based.** Every nutrition choice you make leads to a result. Results can be measured. Results tell us about reality and lead us to determine what to do next. Once you start paying attention to how your body reacts to the food you eat, you can figure out your unique tolerances and preferences. 

_The Game Changers_ revisited
-----------------------------

I rarely revisit previous posts, but I had no choice for this one because the topic is so important. 

When I first watched _The Game Changers_, I did not immediately decide to switch to a vegan or primarily plant-based diet as it recommends. I liked seeing compelling evidence, and it certainly made me want to do more research. Then I listened to the Joe Rogan Experience Episode #1389 linked above in which Chris Kresser debunked many of the claims in the film. After listening to that I was much more skeptical of the film.

I just finished the [3.5-hour episode #1393 of the Joe Rogan Experience](https://youtu.be/s0zgNY_kqlI) in which he invited Chris Kresser back to debate James Wilks, one of the producers of the film and also the narrator.

TLDR (or listen): To use one of my favorite colloquialisms, Chris had his ass handed to him. 

James came to the debate fully prepared and definitively disputed many of the debunking claims Chris put forth. 

My head is spinning after taking in all this information. I don't know how anyone is supposed to interpret all this information and figure out how to "eat healthy." I think the real answer (as always) lies somewhere between the extremes. I don't think either a 100% plant-based diet with zero animal products or a 100% carnivore diet with no plants is the way to go. Just about everyone agrees that the Standard American Diet (SAD!) is terrible, so at least there is some consensus. This makes me want to keep pushing through the nutrition course to learn more science and have more informed opinions about nutrition.
