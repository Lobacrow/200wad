It is now time to create the outline of the book. The outline is the architecture of your book.

Step 1: Brainstorm the chapters of the book. 

What is a chapter? A chapter can be a step in the process or a single, cohesive idea.

You also need a parking lot. This is where you put your really good ideas that do not fit in this book. Save those for another book.

**Frameworks for chapter brainstorming**

Framework #1 Workshop presentation

Imagine you are giving a one-day or two-day workshop about the topic. How would you structure the presentation? 

Framework #2 Teach your book Imagine sitting 1-1 with a good friend who is very interested in the book topic. How would you go about teaching the material to that person?

Framework #3 What needs to be said? If the first two frameworks aren't a good fit, just sit down and write the key ideas of the book and then start to organize them.
