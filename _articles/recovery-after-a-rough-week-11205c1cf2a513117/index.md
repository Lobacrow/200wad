Just when you think you have a nice routine and you have momentum to accomplish daily goals, life intervenes and challenges you. 

This week was my last week onsite for a client I have been working with for just over two years. Last week in Baltimore. Last week in the office. It’s the holidays. All that amounts to a lot of excess eating and disruption to schedule. I wish I could say I was good and stuck to my guns and resisted the temptation but it did not happen. 

Now I am back home and feeling like crap due to lack of sleep among other things. But no excuses. It’s time to get right back on track again. The longer you stay derailed, the longer it will take to get the momentum back that you lost. I need to get back to daily journaling. I need to focus on hitting my daily activity goals. I need to keep my focus on improving sleep. 

At least I have home court advantage until the next assignment. Then I need to figure out how to take the show on the road. It’s okay to fall down as long as you pick yourself right back up. I’m back up. Look out.
