Daniel G. Amen, MD has a new book out called _The End of Mental Illness: How neuroscience is transforming psychiatry and helping prevent or reverse mood and anxiety disorders, ADHD, addictions, PTSD, psychosis, personality disorders, and more._

The thesis of the book is that we are entering a new revolution in the paradigm of mental health care and treatment. We need to eliminate the stigma and shame that surrounds conditions like depression, panic disorders, bipolar disorder, addictions, schizophrenia, and other brain health issues. We need to understand that mental health issues are really **brain health** **issues.** 

If you have crushing chest pain, your doctor will scan your heart. If you have crushing depression, no one will look at your brain.

If you are sick to your stomach, your doctor will image your abdomen. If you are sick with anxiety, no one will look at your brain. 

If you have a chronic cough, your doctor will x-ray your chest. If alcoholic behavior is ruining your life, no one will look at your brain.

Over the last 30 years, Dr. Amen has performed more than 160,000 brain SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) scans, which measure blood flow and activity patterns. This volume of scans has led him to the conclusion that many so-called mental health disorders have root causes in the brain itself. 

We know the brain is important. Your brain accounts for only 2 percent of your body weight, yet it uses 20 to 30 percent of the calories you consume and 20 percent of the oxygen and blood flow in your body. There are several foundational principles of brain function:

*   Your brain is involved in everything you do.
*   When your brain works right, you work right.
*   Your brain is the most complicated organ in the universe.
*   Your brain has needs that must be met in order to work at optimal efficiency.
*   Your brain is soft, and it is housed in a very hard skull.
*   Many things can hurt the brain.
*   Many things can help the brain.
*   Like an orchestra, all parts of your brain need to be working well together to make you the best that you can be.
*   Understanding your brain helps you identify specific problems and which part of your brain may need help.
*   Psychiatric "illnesses" are not single or simple disorders; they all have multiple types that require their own treatments. 
*   The amount of "brain reserve" you have can help you handle life's stresses or make you more vulnerable to them.
*   You are not stuck with the brain you have. You can make it better without using medication.

Dr. Amen uses the following mnemonic to list the 11 major risk factors that affect brain performance:

BRIGHT MINDS

B is for Blood Flow

R is for Retirement and Aging

I is for Inflammation

G is for Genetics

H is for Head Trauma

T is for Toxins

M is for Mind Storms

I is for Immunity and Infections

N is for Neurohormone issues

D is for Diabesity

S is for Sleep

If you want to make changes that will positively impact your brain, start small.

When you come to a decision point in your day, ask "Is the decision I'm about to make good for my brain or bad for it?" If you consistently make good decisions, your brain and mental health will begin to improve immediately.

Every day when your feet hit the floor in the morning, say to yourself, "Today is going to be a great day!" That way your subconscious mind will find why it will be a great day. This helps to train your brain to look for what is right rather than what is wrong.

Every night before bed, mentally note or write down what went well that day. Research suggests this activity can improve your happiness after just one month.

When you feel overwhelmed or stressed, take five deep breaths, taking twice as long to exhale to settle and center yourself.

I'm only on Chapter 5 of the book, but I have already found many helpful tips and strategies that I will begin using right away.

If you are interested in the topic or have loved ones who might be interested, I highly recommend this book. It is filled with practical tips and advice on how to improve your brain to improve your life.
