Many people have the opinion that we are in the Golden Age of Television. They point to the "prestige dramas" in which each episode feels like a mini-movie. I am not doubting the quality of the content, but it's not just about the content but also one's access to it. 

For those of us old enough to remember, we used to get our content from a package of channels on cable or satellite TV. There were also premium channels like HBO, Showtime, and Cinemax that had separate fees. The problem with this model is that all the content was bundled together, and we paid one fee for all of it whether we wanted it or not. Don't watch sports? Too bad, you're getting ESPN anyway. The dream we had back then was to have a la carte programming--we pay for only the channels (or shows) that we want. It should be cheaper, and we should only get the content we want. Be careful what you wish for. 

The a-la-carte dream never materialized the way I expected. Due to licensing deals, there are plenty of movies and shows available through multiple platforms. The kicker is that these content providers are each offering their own exclusive content. This wasn't as bad when you only had a couple of premium services like HBO, but now it's gotten out of control. Do you want to catch the _Stranger Things_ craze? Only on Netflix. What about the _Handmaid's Tale_? Only on Hulu. Itching to see Baby Yoda on _The Mandalorian_? Only on Disney+. 

Let's have a look at just a sample of the cheapest available options. This list does not include the cable- and satellite-replacement services.

Netflix: $8.99/mo

Hulu: $5.99/mo

Amazon Prime: $9.92/mo ($119/year)

Apple TV+: $4.99/mo

Disney+: $6.99/mo

CBS All Access: $5.99/mo

The Criterion Channel: $10.99/mo

DC Universe: $7.99/mo

ESPN+: $4.99/mo

HBO Now: $14.99/mo

Showtime: $10.99/mo

Cinemax: $9.99/mo

Starz: $8.99/mo

YouTube Premium: $11.99/mo

Now, you don't have to subscribe to all these services, but if you do it's over $120/month. So much for getting rid of expensive cable or satellite TV.

Content is king. As long as there is content you "must watch," you'll be paying for it. Perhaps the answer is you don't have to watch what everyone else is watching. 

I [canceled DirecTV](https://200wordsaday.com/words/i-canceled-directv-159565cc61e3364eed) in April. To answer @knight 's question: I have Netflix, Amazon Prime, and HBO Now (a holdover from GoT that I will soon cancel). I also have one year free of Disney+ courtesy of my Verizon account. I have purposely limited the amount of time I spend in front of the TV. 

Perhaps next I will write about another medium that is truly experiencing its Golden Age--podcasts.
