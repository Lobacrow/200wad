This post can probably be in the catalog of the Consultant Code.

Since many people are working remotely, internet connectivity has transformed from a luxury to a necessity. There was a consultant on my project whose internet went out and somehow that meant he was completely unavailable.

If my internet goes out, my back-up is a mobile hotspot. When I was traveling, it was convenient to have a hotspot in case the internet was acting up at the hotel or if I needed to access the internet on the go. It's also more secure than relying on a public WIFI hotspot. If the back-up goes out, I would consider going to a coffee shop or another public spot depending on how long the outage is projected to last. All else fails, if I have no access to the internet, I have my regular meeting dial-in numbers and meeting codes to call into meetings.Â 

As a last resort, if I am dead in the water, I don't bill any hours.
