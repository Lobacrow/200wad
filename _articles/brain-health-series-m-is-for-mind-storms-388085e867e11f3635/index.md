Abnormal electrical activity can not only change the activity of the brain, but it can also change your mind and cause mind storms that can be associated with temper outbursts, depression, suicidal thoughts, panic attacks, distractibility, and confusion.

The brain is a hybrid electrochemical engine. The electricity needs to remain balanced. Too much or too little electricity in the brain can lead to problems. 

Possible triggers:

*   Stress
*   Tiredness
*   Lack of sleep
*   Forgetting medications
*   Hyperventilating
*   Alcohol and drug abuse
*   Low or high blood sugar states
*   Missing meals
*   Premenstrual syndrome
*   Illnesses
*   Pain
*   Video games for vulnerable brains
*   Excessive screen time

There are also certain foods, food colors, and food preservatives that could be triggers such as sugar, MSG, aspartame, and Red Dye #40. 

A ketogenic diet has been used in the treatment of epilepsy since the 1920s. There are also studies that show it may be helpful with mood stabilization. That said, it's not for everyone. 

**My Action Steps:**

*   Maintain a consistent meditation practice
*   Use breathing techniques to reduce stress
*   Prioritize sleep 
*   Take a magnesium supplement
*   Commit to some type of physical activity every day
