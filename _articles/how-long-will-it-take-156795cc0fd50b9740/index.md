When you start learning something new, one of the natural questions to ask is how long will it take to get good?

The answer is that it is entirely up to you. Perhaps start by asking a different question.

> “I don’t ask how long will it take to get good at something. I ask how long do I want it to take.” —Tony Robbins

When I graduated college and started teaching junior high students, I had limited experience speaking in front of groups. In fact, I was terrible at public speaking. But I had to get really good really fast as a teacher. I learned the hard way what happens when you lose control of thirty pubescent teenagers. Let's call it on-the-job training.

In addition to learning by doing, I watched veteran teachers. I asked lots of questions. I learned by trial and error. I learned fast because I had to and because I put in the hours everyday consistently. 

Years ago I watched an [informercial](https://youtu.be/LEEue6riAK4) where the artist Esteban was offering an acoustic guitar and video lessons. I got sucked in and bought the guitar. I had no prior musical experience except a few organ lessons when I was in grade school. My plan was to practice once or twice a week. It didn't last long. I discovered I do not have a natural ability to play guitar. My fingers constantly hurt because of how hard I had to press the strings. I never practiced for a long enough time to develop calluses. My hands and fingers are built for typing on a keyboard not playing a guitar. I didn't want it bad enough. And practicing at the rate of once or twice a week meant it would take a VERY long time to get good at playing the guitar. 

If you want to learn a new skill, don't ask how long it will take to get good. Ask how long you want it to take. Then make a plan to show up and put in the hours consistently to make it happen.
