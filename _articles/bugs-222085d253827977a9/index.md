I encountered the same bug other people did today accessing 200WAD on Safari. Good thing I was in Slack and saw that it was browser-specific (An Apple browser at that..Boo!) So I just switched over to good ol' Firefox. A friend of mine said he has switched over to some new browser called Brave, which is supposed to be very secure and somehow related to crypto currency or blockchain technology. I might give it a whirl at some point.

I do not have time this evening for a more thoughtful post. We have what is referred to as "Game Night" where the consultants gather together in the common area at the hotel for drinks and general merriment. I suppose it's a nice home-away-from-home break from being alone in a hotel room. Although, I rather enjoy being alone. I always seem to find something to keep me occupied.

I am not looking forward to strapping my new shoes back on as they are still in the initial break-in period and have been giving my feet and legs a work out. I haven't had any major issues so far. I'll have a full review after a week of wearing them.
