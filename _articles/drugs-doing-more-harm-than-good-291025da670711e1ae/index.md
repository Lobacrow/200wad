If you or your loved ones are taking prescription medication or even over-the-counter medication, you're going to want to pay attention.

When you go to the grocery store, any food that comes in a package or bag or container must list the manufacturer, nutrition information, and ingredients. But think about a prescription medicine from your doctor. Have you ever asked who manufactured the drug or where it was manufactured and what's in it? I know I haven't. I didn't think I had to ask. We trust that the regulations are in place to keep us safe.

Think again.

Recently I listened to quite the one-two punch of podcast episodes. Dr. Peter Attia has a podcast called The Drive, and he recently put the spotlight on the drug industry.

The first episode I listened to is [#71 - Katherine Eban: Widespread fraud in the generic drug industry.](https://peterattiamd.com/katherineeban/) I was appalled to hear about what's really going on in the manufacturing of drugs, especially generic drugs. Approximately 80% of generic drugs are manufactured in India and China, and let's just say the vast majority of the drugs are not independently tested.

The second episode is #[75 - David Light: Zantac recall due to cancer concerns--what you need to know.](https://peterattiamd.com/davidlight/) The drug Zantac was tested and found to contain excessive amounts of a chemical known as NDMA. This chemical is classified as a "probable human carcinogen." They can't outright classify it as a human carcinogen because that would require unethical studies subjecting human beings to this chemical. But get this, the chemical NDMA is used as _a control to induce cancer in lab rats_. That's enough proof for me!

After listening to these two episodes, my worst fears about drugs have been realized. Forget about the side effects and unintended consequences of the active ingredients in the medication. Now we have to worry about contaminants and harmful chemicals. By the way, this also applies to over-the-counter medication as well.

I have further reinforced my view that I want to avoid taking medication unless it is absolutely necessary. If you don't want to listen to these episodes, at least make time to get educated about any medications or even supplements that you are taking. They could be causing you more harm than good.
