For those of you new to the community, if you have a goal to improve your writing by establishing a daily writing habit then we have a team for you. If you post every day and achieve a streak of at least 30 days, we will welcome you to #Teamstreak.

Unfortunately, #Teamstreak is down to 24 members. So, it's time for another call-to-arms. @jacklyons asked recently whether [streaks are important](https://200wordsaday.com/words/are-streaks-important-197245cfc561394e19). My unequivocal answer is yes the streak is important (much to the chagrin of our dear founder @basilesamel ). 

One of the key differences between successful and unsuccessful people is discipline.

> Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment. --Jim Rohn

Discipline means it doesn't matter whether you feel like doing something. You do it anyway. You can have debates with yourself or negotiate with yourself or you can simply do what you need to do. 

A streak represents discipline. You owe it to yourself to be disciplined about the things that matter the most to you. 

Well, maybe I'll skip a day of writing. Maybe I'll skip a day of being active or working out. Maybe I'll stay up late to watch some movie and catch up on my sleep on the weekend. One cheat day on my diet won't be a big deal. Stop with the maybes and stop letting yourself off the hook. I've said before that [inaction becomes a habit](https://200wordsaday.com/words/inaction-becomes-a-habit-163715ccc60ab9a1fb). All it takes is one miss. 

I've also said that #Teamstreak is not for everyone. If you write for fun or it's just a hobby that's great. There's probably another team for you. But if you are serious about improving your writing and want to get better a little bit every day, stop dabbling. 

@articloon recently published the 900th post in a row. And you are telling me you are serious about writing and can't even post for 30 days in a row?? Maybe you are posting somewhere else and good for you. For #Teamstreak it's all about posting on 200WAD every day.

I also have a message for the people who used to be in #Teamstreak and are not anymore. If your priorities changed, I understand. No hard feelings. If it was never a serious endeavor for you, I get it. But if you let yourself off the hook, it's time to get back in the game. 

Discipline.

I know it's not easy. But you're not alone. There is a community of support. We are here to help each other, encourage each other, and keep each other motivated to continue toward our dreams and goals.

It is interesting to look back on this post from one year ago. I was complaining that #Teamstreak was down to 24 members, and now we are "only" at 16 members.

The people in the 500 Club know that a streak matters:

@basilesamel

@knight

@jasonleow

@arcticloon

@efran

And let's not forget Mr. 400 Club @phaidenbauer.

Some people will argue that randomly writing 100 posts in one year is the same as writing one post every day for 100 days. Same output right? 

A streak matters.

There are many habits I have tried to establish, but none of them have survived as long as daily writing. This is the one I do no matter what. By the way, I rarely schedule a post even though that is an option for [Patrons](https://cowriters.app/words/become-a-patron-310255dcc34b24014d). I view writing every day like exercise, and it happens to be one of the few exercises that I enjoy.

Are people reading? Who knows. Are people writing? Yes, the members of #Teamstreak are showing up every day, and I enjoy seeing them here knowing they are practicing the habit the same as I am.

I'm here because I want to be here. It's not drudgery. It's not a chore. If you feel that way about writing, maybe this gig isn't for you.

I'm not going anywhere. We're not going anywhere.

A streak matters.

We are #Teamstreak!!!!!!
