No it's not one of the standard "summary" posts. I did a [version of that](https://bewellthy.substack.com/p/october-2020-summary) for my newsletter. As the cliché goes, October flew by. 

It was nice getting a newsletter up and running this month. I decided against my original plan to post twice a week and stick with a weekly schedule. I think this works best for my available time right now.

For those keeping score at home, I have 82 subscribers. I did pull over approximately 60 people from a previous email list, but I weeded out over half of them who were not opening any of the Be Wellthy emails.

At this point, I'm focusing on honing my voice for the newsletter and delivering content for a specific audience. I will continue the experiment through November and December, and then decide whether I will continue in the same form in 2021.

It's going to be a quiet Halloween for me. I'll be alone and watching scary movies. IT: Chapter 2 is in the queue. Perhaps some scary Netflix series will be next. Most of the US will be gaining an hour tomorrow. I wonder if people will make the best of it or simply waste it. No change for AZ.
