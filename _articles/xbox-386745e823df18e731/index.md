Over the weekend I decided to fire up the XBOX. I haven't played in many months, and I decided I would take a break from productive tasks and have some fun.

I booted up the XBOX only to be routed immediately to a system update. I watched as the percentage complete slowly ticked away. This was going to take awhile. So I decided to go for a bike ride and hoped it would be done when I got back.

I got back home 30 minutes later and the update was still not done! I wasted some time, and finally, the XBOX rebooted and was ready to go. I booted up Borderlands 3 and was faced with yet another update! You have got to be kidding me. A 9 GB file update for the game?? So much for a break! I went back to writing, and it wasn't until a little over an hour later the game was finally updated and ready to play. By that time, I wasn't even in the mood. I completed one objective and then turned it off.

So much for the days when you could just sit down and play a quick game. That's what I get for sneaking away from productive tasks.
