As [I wrote about previously](https://cowriters.app/words/nba-jam-436075f2a1391af4e9), I have been enjoying playing my favorite arcade game NBA Jam. Although it's not all fun and games. Arcade games, after all, are designed to get you to spend as much money as possible, and that translates into a frustrating experience sometimes when I'm just trying to casually play the game at home, e.g., the computer cheats to keep the games close.

I mentioned to a buddy of mine that I bought the game, and I discovered that he is very big into retro gaming and knows guys who can modify consoles and install a variety of games. These "modded" consoles are sold on the black market due to the dubious legality around owning the ROMS for these games.

I decided to buy an original XBOX that has been modded with a ton of retro games, and I mean a TON.Â 

Here's what it includes:

*   Selection of original XBOX games
*   Coin-ops - over 2,000 original coin-op arcade games along with 2,000 more other games from different systems.
*   Original NES (full library)
*   Sega Master System and Game Gear (full library)
*   Sega Genesis (full library)
*   Super Nintendo (full library)
*   Turbo Grafix 16 (full library)
*   Nintendo 64 selection of games
*   Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Color (full library)

I just started playing with it today, and I am a kid in the world's biggest candy store! This is the true dream for anybody who has enjoyed playing any of these video games previously.

The biggest question now is what to play next?
