Recently I watched an episode of _The Big Interview_ with Dan Rather who interviewed Simon Cowell. For many years Simon was one of the infamous judges on _American Idol_. He also created the show _The X Factor_. Needless to say, he is quite successful.

One particular quote from Simon struck me. Dan asked him after having such success, what continues to drive him to achieve more. Simon's answer was the following: "The getting there was more fun than being there."

People like the saying, "Keep your eye on the prize." Unfortunately, we are often too focused on the prize. We are too focused on the final result. This reminds me of another quote:

> Success without fulfillment is the ultimate failure. --Tony Robbins

It's good to have goals and targets to reach. But it shouldn't be drudgery every day until you reach the end result. Enjoy the process. If you are not enjoying the process, maybe what you have decided to do isn't right for you. After all, the time spent climbing up the mountain far outweighs the time spent standing at the top enjoying the view.Â 

I have goals that I want to reach. I do have my "eye on the prize." But I'm also trying to enjoy the journey to get there.
