[As I wrote about previously](https://cowriters.app/words/project-food-as-fuel-what-s-next-425675f050ddc3bd9e), I am crafting what will be my long-term diet using a variety of sources.

Next up are the food recommendations from a genetic report I received from the company Geno Palate. This report has a lot of information including recommendations for macros (carbs, fats, protein), vitamins and minerals, sensitivities to lactose and gluten, and metabolizing ability for caffeine and alcohol. While the report does recommend an overall low-carb diet for me based on genetics, it also recommends a moderately low-fat diet and moderate-high protein. I'm not sure how all that balances out, but I'm still planning a diet that is generally low carb without being strictly ketogenic.
