I have been wanting to write this one for a long time. How long? Technically a year a half. 

Many of you have been following my journey known as Project Food as Fuel. Today, I'm happy to announce that I've achieved my goal.

I reversed type 2 diabetes.

I wish I had a microphone handy so I could drop it and just walk away.

Instead, what I offer is the article that is a culmination of my journey over the last year. Some of the material will look familiar if you've been following what I've been up to.

I decided to publish this article on Medium because it is the end of my series. 

On January 3, 2019, I published the first story: [This Is How I Will Reverse Type 2 Diabetes](https://medium.com/the-ascent/this-is-how-i-will-reverse-type-2-diabetes-3f97ed6ff1e5). 

On May 5, 2019, I published the second story: [I Am Reversing My Type 2 Diabetes](https://medium.com/the-ascent/i-am-reversing-my-type-2-diabetes-b5b2da1f9589).

Today, March 29, 2020, I published the third story: [I Reversed Type 2 Diabetes.](https://medium.com/@brandonwilson_84606/i-reversed-type-2-diabetes-f284cf6b57c1)

According to Medium, the new story is a 40-minute read. Yikes. So much for editing. If you have been following Project Food as Fuel, then many of the stories will look familiar. If not, settle in for what will hopefully be an informative and entertaining ride.
