"Hey all. I'd like to introduce Dave to the rest of the team. Dave has been with the company for twenty minutes. That's right. Today is Dave's first day, and this is his first team meeting. Dave has accomplished quite a bit in those twenty minutes. He filled out his direct deposit form, including deciphering which number on the check is the routing number vs the account number. He set up his Outlook including his signature. He also logged into the training portal and somehow already completed the sexual harassment training, which normally takes a full hour.Â 

I see that Dave and I are the only two people on the Zoom meeting with our cameras on. Maybe we can get more team members to go camera-ready in the future.
