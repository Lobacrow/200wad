When is the last time you went through the dial of your local radio stations? Let's assume we are talking FM stations because AM radio went out with powdered wigs. I get suckered in to listening to the radio because it's free and convenient. It's the thing that comes on right away when you turn it on in your car. No connecting your phone to a cord or using bluetooth. 

I have five stations programmed, and I cannot tell you how many times I have cycled through all five stations with commercials on every station. Just as bad is hearing the same song over and over on multiple stations. Some stations claim they play a little of everything, yet why is it you still hear the same pop songs that are played on other stations?

Here is another one. Ever hear a song that you haven't heard in a long time, and all of a sudden you hear it multiple times on different stations? 

I have a theory about what is causing these phenomena--human beings are not actually programming content anymore. Computers are determining the radio station content. It's cheaper than having actual people do it. 

The solution is to stop listening to the radio. Why listen to a computer's idea of a playlist when you can listen to your own? Better yet, why not listen to a podcast and learn something new to improve your life? 

What you read, what you watch, what you listen to all affect your focus and your brain at a conscious and subconscious level. Be mindful of what you are focusing on. Tune out the radio and tune in to content that is going to help you achieve your goals and lead a happier, healthier life.
