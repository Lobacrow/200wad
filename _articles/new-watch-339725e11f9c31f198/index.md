When I was a kid, I remember a specific analog clock on the wall. It looked like a giant version of a pocket watch. What I hated about it was that the numbers were Roman numerals. I had the hardest time figuring out what time it was before I learned Roman numerals.Â 

As an adult, that memory seems silly to me. If I see an analog clock on the wall without numbers, I can still easily tell the time based on the placement of the hands. This fact must have been lost on me in my youth.

I started wearing watches in elementary school. I favored digital watches, perhaps due to my aversion to the Roman numerals-style clock. I remember in 4th grade I had a Casio calculator watch, for which I was accused of cheating on math tests. At a moment's notice, I would remove the watch and hand it to someone and say, "Okay, let's see who's faster with times tables." I didn't lose. This watch also had a game that was a crude version of Space Invaders. Everyone loved that game, and I would frequently have my arm commandeered by someone who wanted to play. I didn't mind so much when it was a cute girl.

At some point as an adult, I stopped wearing watches for several years. Once I had the original iPhone in 2007, I always had a device with the time. When the Apple Watch came out, I was coaxed into wearing a watch again. The novelty wore off quite quickly. I ditched the Apple Watch almost a year ago, which I [previously posted about](https://200wordsaday.com/words/i-ditched-the-apple-watch-and-this-is-what-i-wear-instead-86145c620b187280f). I also ditched the FitBit a few months ago. The trigger for that was the band wore out from flexing in the same spot, and I didn't take the time to order another band. I was wearing it less and less anyway because I was getting too obsessed with getting my steps for the day.

What do I really want from a watch? Not much. Primarily, tell me the time and perhaps the weather. Provide some sort of fitness tracking. Nudge me to move if I've been sitting too long. Allow me to time something if needed. Everything else is gravy. Also, I'm already charging my phone daily so I don't need another device that also needs to be charged daily. My needs are a bit more than a traditional watch but far less than the current crop of "smartwatches."

My new watch is called the [Fossil Hybrid Smartwatch HR](https://www.fossil.com/us/en/products/hybrid-smartwatch-hr-collider-black-silicone-sku-ftw7010p.html). I was drawn by the style, minimal functionality, and purported 2-week battery life. I'm taking it on the road this week to see whether I can become a watch-wearing person again. Ironically, there are no numbers on the face (Roman numerals or otherwise). No Space Invaders either. Ahh well, can't have everything.
