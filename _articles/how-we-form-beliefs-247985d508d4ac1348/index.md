Here is how we _think_ we form abstract beliefs:

1\. We hear something; 

2\. We think about it and vet it, determining whether it is true or false; only after that

3\. We form our belief.

Here is how we _actually_ form abstract beliefs:

1\. We hear something; 

2\. We believe it to be true;

3\. Only sometimes, later, if we have the time or the inclination, we think about it and vet it, determining whether it is, in fact, true or false.

There are various explanations for this. From an evolutionary perspective, we evolved to believe what we see and experience in the physical world. Better to be safe than sorry, so the trait of being highly skeptical was not selected for. As complex language evolved, we were able to form beliefs about things not actually experienced. The "believe-it-first-and-ask-questions-later" tendency remained. This is a very simplified telling.

There are lots of studies and experiments that demonstrate how our beliefs shape our thinking and how biases can influence what we believe. One of the most powerful is the confirmation bias, which states that we tend to seek out evidence to confirm a belief and ignore or work hard to discredit information that contradicts a belief. 

I need to start paying more attention to what I read and what I hear and evaluate information with an inquisitive mind.
