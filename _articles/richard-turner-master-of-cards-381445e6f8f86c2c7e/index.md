In case you are looking for some content, I have a suggestion for you.

On [Episode 411 of The Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/2020/02/20/richard-turner/), Tim interviewed Richard Turner.

Richard Turner is what is referred to as a card shark (or as the Brits say a card sharp). He doesn't call himself a card magician but rather a card mechanic. He says a mechanic fixes things, and that's what he can do with card games. He can do things magicians cannot do. He can make any card appear in any hand at any time. It's mind-boggling to watch him.

Richard is obsessed with a deck of cards. He always has a deck of cards in his hands, and he can shuffle one-handed like it's the easiest thing in the world. He is a consultant for the largest playing card manufacturers and can detect subtle changes in card quality. He named his only son Asa Spades.Â 

He is also extremely disciplined. He practices for 16 hours a day. He told Tim he has not missed a workout in 49 years. He earned a sixth-degree black belt by fighting 10 fresh fighters in 10 rounds despite having a broken arm in the seventh round. The next day the L.A. Times published a story about his accomplishment, but he hated the story and never showed it to anyone. Why? Because they focused on the fact that he's blind.

I watched the documentary about Richard's life called _Dealt_, which you can r[ent on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Dealt-Richard-Turner/dp/B076HDLY9W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=dealt+documentary&qid=1582137992&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=offsitoftimfe-20&linkId=7fb6ddc77de663e98a678b6468739411&language=en_US) for $3.99. Tim ranked this documentary as one of his all-time favorites and I can see why. Richard Turner has an amazing story, and even if you're not interested in cards, there are many lessons you can learn from his experience.
