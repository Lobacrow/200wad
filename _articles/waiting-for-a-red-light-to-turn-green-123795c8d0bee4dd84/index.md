I recently read that the average person will spend six months of his or her life waiting for red lights to turn green. I suppose this is a small price to pay for the convenience of owning one's own vehicle and having the freedom to drive virtually anywhere.

Stoplights are necessary to maintain order with traffic. I have seen videos of traffic in other countries like India in which there are areas with no traffic lights, and it looks like pure chaos.Â 

I wonder about the metaphorical stoplights that pop up in our lives. We are waiting for the right moment, the signal that it's okay to make a decision or move forward. We wait and wait for the light to turn from red to green because that is what we are supposed to do.

What if the light isn't going to turn green? What if it just looks like a stoplight because you want some external factor to make the decision for you? You are waiting for that sure flash of green to have 100% confidence that you can move forward. But there is never 100% confidence. You may have the green light, but if someone decides to run a red light at the moment you are crossing the intersection it will be bad news.

What are the things in your life that look like stoplights to you? Are you waiting for a red light that is never going to turn green?
