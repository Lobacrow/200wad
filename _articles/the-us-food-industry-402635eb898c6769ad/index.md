I have varied interests and listen to a variety of opinions. I freely admit that when I used to have cable, I watched Megyn Kelly's show and Bill O'Reilly's show on the Fox channel. I also watched Bill Maher's show on HBO. I like hearing all kinds of opinions and like to stay informed so that I can create my own informed opinions.

I recently saw a clip of Bill Maher [talking about the US food industry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OoT2OZWCOI) and it was quite salient. There is a lot of attention paid to the "wet markets" in Asia and in particular Wuhan, where the novel coronavirus supposedly transferred from animals to humans. There isn't as much attention paid to the way livestock and factory farming cause harm to animals in the US.

Here is one example of the problem. To get that $0.99 dozen of eggs, the chickens are raised in horrible conditions. I won't go into the details, but it's pretty scary. Today I bought a $5.99 dozen of eggs from chickens that are "free-range" and raised humanely. I don't want to support the factory-farming industry, and unfortunately, it means my wallet takes a hit. Most people are not willing to pay a higher price for better food products, which means there isn't much incentive for the system to change.
