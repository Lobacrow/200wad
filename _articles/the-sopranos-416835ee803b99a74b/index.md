The HBO series [_The Sopranos_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sopranos) is considered to be one of the greatest television series of all time. In fact, it was my favorite series until _Breaking Bad_ knocked it off its perch. 

I enjoyed watching _The Sopranos_ when it was airing and have many fond memories of the show. Unfortunately, the series was tainted for me by the extremely controversial series finale. Some people thought it was a great ending. I am not one of those people.

I never thought I would revisit the show, but then I discovered a new podcast called [_Talking Sopranos_](https://talkingsopranos.simplecast.com/) hosted by two of the series regulars (Michael Imperioli who played Christopher Multisanti and Steve Schirippa who played Bobby Bacala). The premise of the podcast is to provide insight into the making of the show by reviewing each of the 86 episodes. I listened to the first episode of the podcast and got hooked. Now I find myself wanting to go back and watch the series again. 

If someone asked me whether I recommend watching _The Sopranos_, I would provide a qualified recommendation. The series has superb writing and acting. Each episode is like a mini-movie. It does center around the mob, so you have to be able to stomach quite a bit of violence. Also, you should know going in that the finale will leave you unsatisfied.
