I have always lived in a world with _Star Wars_. The first _Star Wars_ movie was released in May of 1977, and I was born in September of 1977. I don't remember seeing the original movies in the theater. I do remember watching them on TV.

The musical score for _Star Wars_ by John Williams could be the best of all time. It is amazing to me how music makes the movies. For example, take a look at the throne room scene at the end of [Episode IV without the musical score](https://youtu.be/Tj-GZJhfBmI). Now watch the [same scene with the original score](https://youtu.be/iH6a1iYQ0GA) from the movie. 

I finally saw the original _Star Wars_ movies on the big screen in 1997, with the release of the Special Editions to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the original movie. I remember watching episodes IV, V, and VI back-to-back-to-back one afternoon and evening while they were all still playing in the theater. 

The fact that these were called Episodes IV, V, and VI created speculation that we were going to get the first three episodes, and we did starting with _The Phantom Menace_ in 1999. I saw this movie with my father, and I remember we both enjoyed it despite its shortcomings and annoyances (Looking at you Jar Jar). Episodes II and III followed, and while each movie had its moments, nothing could top the original three movies for me.

Many years ago I remember hearing rumors that _Star Wars_ creator George Lucas had planned three additional movies after _Ep. VI: Return of the Jedi_. I never thought it would happen. Lucas sold the franchise to Disney and sure enough, we got three more movies with the last release _The Return of Skywalker_ this weekend. 

I'm sad that the era of _Star Wars_ that started in 1977 has concluded. I look forward to more shows and stand-alone movies. I don't think another series of movies in this universe will match what has already been accomplished with these nine films. 

People take entertainment too seriously. There is so much controversy about the most recent _Star Wars_ movies. This is what happens when you grow up and forget what it was like to be a kid. I'm not going to wade in on the debate or even give my specific opinions about the movies. Suffice it to say that these movies make me feel like a kid again and that's all that matters.
