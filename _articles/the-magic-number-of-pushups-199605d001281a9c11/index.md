I read [this article](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/if-you-can-do-this-many-pushups-in-a-row-harvard-scientists-say-youre-at-over-30-times-less-risk-of-heart-attack.html) recently that presents a theory that the number of pushups you can do is an indicator of your overall cardiovascular health and risk for a heart attack or stroke. The magic number is 40. If you can sustain 40 pushups or more, you are 96% less likely to experience a cardiac event compared to someone who can only do 10 or fewer pushups. 

I am pretty sure going all the way back to high school that I have never been physically fit enough to sustain 40 pushups. Heck, as I read the story I was questioning whether I could even do 40 _wall_ pushups (I can.) In the last few years, my upper body strength has eroded due in part to a case of frozen shoulder. I was working in a conference room on a laptop, and let's just say that is not a good idea ergonomically. I went through some painful physical therapy, and my shoulder is pretty well healed. Now I have no excuse. 

I need to start focusing on some strength training, and I think pushups are as good a place as any to start. I can do them anywhere, and there is a low risk of injury. I am starting from scratch, well below the 10 pushup threshold. It's really quite pathetic. I have to actually start on my knees doing "girl" pushups. Don't yell at me ladies, that's what they are called. :)

The goal is 40 standard pushups. I have no idea how long it will take me to get there. But I'm not going to focus on the mountain. I'm going to focus on the first step, then the next step, and the step after that. One day at a time. Pushups every day. Let the streak begin.
