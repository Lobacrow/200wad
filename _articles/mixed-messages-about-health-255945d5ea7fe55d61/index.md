I work for a client in California. When I am onsite, I notice all the attempts by the organization to encourage healthy behaviors. In the break room there are various signs and posters, some good and some bad. 

Good: 

*   Cut out the sugar.
*   Drink more water.
*   Eat unprocessed, whole foods.
*   Stretch and move around throughout the day.

Bad:

*   Eat lowfat everything. 
*   Avoid sodium.

Fat and sodium have been demonized to the point that most people who are uneducated on the topic just assume they are both categorically bad.

What really gets me is the mixed messages about health. I'll never forget when I saw two posters side-by-side on a door. One advertised a free wellness check-up. The other one advertised hot dog Friday, in which a hot dog, chips, and soda could be had for $5. 

What good is all the messaging about a healthy lifestyle when you are sitting in a training room and a giant bowl of M&M's (plain and peanut) and Snickers magically appears during a break? Or you walk into the break room and on the table next to the sign that reads "Cut out the sugar" there is a box of donuts left over from some meeting. Or every third cubicle has a dish or bowl of some type of hard candy or sweets. 

Thankfully, since I cut out sugar some time ago these temptations do not hold power over me and I can avoid them pretty easily.

Years ago I sought the advice of a personal trainer. His name was Roland and he was from Croatia. He had an accent that sounded similar to the accent of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Here is a memorable conversation we had.

Roland: You need to walk more at work.

BW: Sure, I do that every day when I walk down to Burger King.

Roland: What?! No more Burger King.

BW: Okay fine, but what about Subway?

Roland: Subway maybe but it depends. I went to Subway for a sandwich, and they ask me if I want a "value meal." I ask, "what is this?" They say, "chips and a soda." I say, "Where is the extra value in that?"
