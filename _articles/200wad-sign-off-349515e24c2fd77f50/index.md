I am thrilled that this is the team going forward into the great beyond. I have been watching, showing up next to you, side-by-side every day. I don't know what the future holds for this site, but I am optimistic and trusting in Baz's capable hands.

You might wonder what will happen on the new site once the 200-word limit is dropped. Technically, if someone posts one word each day, that is some sort of streak. If someone wants to walk into a gym every day, lift one dumbbell (yes I picked that piece of equipment specifically) and walk out of the gym, that is that person's choice. Maybe someone will start some sort of team for those people, but #Teamstreak does not have room for that nonsense. We also don't tolerate people who post the exact same content multiple days in a row. I want to let the team know that I won't allow #Teamstreak to be watered down. I hope that people will behave normally but rest assured if I see some riff-raff, the judgment will be swift and direct.Â 

I share Baz's vision to enable more people to write and create consistent writing habits. Cheers to the next phase of this journey and this community.
