Last night I finally went to go see _Bohemian Rhapsody_, the biopic of Freddie Mercury and the band Queen. If you are a music fan, I would encourage you to go see it. Try to avoid reviews and people's opinions and judge the movie for yourself. That said I will offer a few of my thoughts.

First and foremost actor Rami Malek deserves an Academy Award for his portrayal of Freddie Mercury. His ability to portray Freddie at different stages of his life, his attempts at singing some of the parts himself, and his stage presence indeed captured Freddie's spirit.

The film focuses primarily on his relationships along with clever editing that introduced some of the band's biggest hits. The film keeps a good pace showing us the talented but quirky nature of Freddie and how it affected his personal relationships.Â 

All movies take liberties with the facts, so if you are looking for a factual and historically-accurate depiction of the Freddie or Queen this movie will leave you disappointed. What the movie does provide is over two hours of entertainment with a great story about humble beginnings, fame, and the rise and fall of an extremely talented artist.
