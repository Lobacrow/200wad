According to my countdown widget, I have 14 days left until 12/5/20. That will be the day of my last post on this site. 

I'm going to stick around, of course. I want to see other folks reach milestones. Down with the ship, as I've said.

I'm not sure if a new platform will be up and running by then. If not, then I will continue to write privately every day, and I will continue my newsletter weekly until we get the gang back together.

@jasonleow and @arcticloon are both working feverishly on two new platforms. It will be exciting to see how things shake out and where people will end up. Maybe some of the old timers we haven't seen in awhile will come out of the woodwork. 

I do like the idea of a fresh start. Even better if it does NOT coincide with January 1st. Frankly, I am tired of New Year's resolutions, and people trying to start some new habit and flaming out a few days or weeks in. In fact, I'm not planning much for 2021. It's time to just do the work. Enough thinking about the destination and just focus on moving in that direction a little each day.
