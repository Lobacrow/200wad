I was disturbed today to learn that Buzzfeed published an article detailing allegations of abuse and harassment by Tony Robbins. Lest you be mislead, Buzzfeed is NOT a reputable news source. Don't take my word for it, just look at the [research](https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2014/liberals-and-conservatives-agree-you-cant-trust-buzzfeed/). If you want cute stories about cats, by all means go to Buzzfeed. If you want trustworthy news, look elsewhere.

I am not going to link to the Buzzfeed article, but I will link to [Tony's statement on Medium.](https://medium.com/@TonyRobbins/an-open-letter-to-buzzfeed-editors-and-board-of-directors-from-tony-robbins-e78f2c11e8af) You can read the Buzzfeed article and Tony's response and judge for yourself.

Full disclosure: I have seen Tony Robbins live. I have purchased his books and training materials. I believe in his mission and what he does to help people all over the world. In fact, last night I watched a video from Tony that was delivered to people who purchased the Knowledge Business Blueprint course. The topic of this video will be a future post.

I still believe in innocent until proven guilty. If Tony did something he shouldn't have, then he should be held accountable. 

You have to be careful where you get your news. You also have to be careful about what you are paying attention to. Consider the source of information and whether there are ulterior motives at play.
