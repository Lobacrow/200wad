Back in the good ol' days when I used to work full time in an office, a co-worker named David told me a story that I found quite humorous much to his chagrin.

David and his wife worked for the same company but in different departments, and they carpooled to and from the office every day. One day, after a long day of work and lengthy commute through heavy afternoon traffic, David and his wife arrived home. As soon as he opened his front door, he felt a cold swoosh of air.

"Why is it so cold in here?"

He had to ask the question multiple times because his 20-something son was playing XBOX and talking on a headset, which is how he had been spending most of his summer days.

"Why is it so cold in here??"

"Oh, I don't know I was sweating and it was hot so I turned the AC down."

David walked over to the thermostat and was shocked to find it set to 70 degrees F. In the heat of an Arizona summer there is always the push and pull of wanting to keep a house cool enough while avoiding an exorbitant electric bill. For reference, most people keep the AC no cooler than 77 during the day in the summer.

David then walked into the kitchen and was immediately hit with a blast of hot air.

"Why is it so hot in here??"

He knew his son couldn't hear him, but he asked the question nevertheless. He saw an empty Tombstone frozen pizza wrapper on the counter and immediately walked to the oven, which was empty but turned on to 450 degrees.Â 

He confronted his son who said he made a frozen pizza for lunch and must have forgotten to turn the oven off, which explained why the house was heating up causing him to crank the AC down.

Kids.
