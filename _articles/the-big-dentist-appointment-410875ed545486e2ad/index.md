It's not bigger than any other appointment, but in this day and age, any appointment feels like a big deal now. 

I get dental check-ups every six months just like kiddies do. It turns out that the condition of your teeth and gums correlates to other aspects of your health. For example, before someone receives an organ transplant, he or she gets a very thorough oral exam and receives any needed dental treatment. In fact, poor dental health might disqualify one from receiving an organ transplant because of the risk of infection.

The two biggest areas of consideration for the mouth are the teeth and gums. I've had issues with both. Years ago I had a "dark period" when I was not taking care of myself properly. I went for several years without visiting the dentist, and I paid the price. I had severe gum disease that required a "deep cleaning treatment" to get back in order. If you don't take care of your gums, you create many problems for yourself including teeth eventually falling out. 

Thankfully, I did not have any teeth fall out but I have had a couple of cavities. I never had cavities as a kid, but somehow I have had a few as an adult. I had a cavity filled on one of my lower molars a year ago, and that eventually led to a cracked tooth that required a replacement with a crown, which I had done in November of last year. 

This crown has never felt right. I have a sensitivity to cold and some pain when I bite down on the left side. No matter how accurate the mold is, the dentist usually has to make an adjustment to ensure a proper bite with the existing tooth. I had my "adjustment" earlier this year when the dentist used a drill to file down the crown. Now, it's a fake tooth so I shouldn't feel anything right? Wrong. The nerve is still there and since it is irritated I felt it. It feels about as bad as you can imagine a drill would feel on your tooth with no numbing.

I was due for my regular check-up a month ago, but it was postponed and I finally went in today. I had the requisite temperature check and had to fill out a COVID-19 questionnaire. Other than that, it was business as usual. I complained that the crown was causing me grief, and I suffered through another "adjustment." If this one doesn't work, the dentist said I'll need to see a specialist and might have to get a root canal. Lovely.

The moral of the story is take care of your teeth and gums. Brush and floss regularly and get regular dental check-ups. Once you start having gum problems and cavities and crowns, it is a literal pain in the mouth and in the wallet.
