I was waiting for someone to say it. It didn't take long Monday morning for me to hear someone say, "Well, at least it's a short week."

Tell that to Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday! It may be a short week, but it's not realized until after work on Wednesday. Prior to that, it's still a regular week unless you took additional days off.Â 

While we are on the topic, enough of these sales and ads that insist that "Black Friday deals start now!" No they don't. Black Friday deals are only on Black Friday. If it's not occurring on Black Friday, it's not a Black Friday deal. Now, don't get me wrong. If it's a substantial deal on something I need or want, I'm going to take advantage of the deal. I'm not quibbling with the discount. I'm quibbling with the nomenclature.

As you might imagine, this would be a great subject for my podcast. I did record a short episode, but I did not publish it as a podcast. I've only sent it to a few friends. Every now and then I get the urge to record another episode, but I don't know if I should start up season 2.
