"I'm going to meet Mary tomorrow for lunch."

"Where are you meeting her? Panocha Bread?"

"Stop that! It's Panera Bread."

"Well be sure to remind her that she got fired."

"Why would I do that?"

"Because she had delivered to her a pink slip."

"Yes, she got fired but why would I remind her that she got fired?"

"Well, it's been a while and in case she might have a day that goes by where she isn't dwelling on the fact that she got sacked, you can remind her so she continues to remember."

"Have you ever been fired? It's not exactly something you want to keep remembering."

"I have not. But I have heard people who were axed say it was the best thing that ever happened to them. Seems like you'd want to remember something like that and be reminded of it frequently."

"I'm not going to remind her that she was fired."

"I think as soon as you see her you should say, 'Hey Mary, nice to see you! Remember that time they fired your ass??"

"Why don't you go with me so you can tell her that yourself?"

"First off, Panera ewww. Second, I'm not supposed to know that she was shown the door. You know because you're plugged into the pipeline of all that information. If I meet her and say that, the wow factor would be off because she'd be stuck on the idea that I somehow found out that she was canned."

"It's not eww. I'm going to have a bowl of French onion soup."

"Well, if you're not going to remind her of her termination, at least remind her of the time she had one foot out the door and the other on a banana peel."

"I don't know where you get this stuff."
