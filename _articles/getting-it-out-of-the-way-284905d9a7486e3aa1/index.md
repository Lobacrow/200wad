This morning I went out for a bike ride at about 6 AM. It was 65 degrees. That may sound like nice weather, and it is. But when you are used to over 100 degrees, this weather change feels a bit chilly. On a bike, it feels even colder.

I got back home and discovered my joints felt like they were placed in slow motion. I had difficulty texting and even making coffee. I needed a few more minutes to warm up and get back to normal. I wondered if this is a preview of 20 years from now when I start dogging it.

But at least I got it out of the way.

I'm not Mr. Exercise. It's one of the last things I want to do on any given day, but I actually like to do it first. Because then I can get it out of the way.

I like conducting my day without the impending doom of exercise. If I bite the bullet and get it out of the way, then I don't have to worry about it. I may face other challenges in the day, but figuring out where and when to exercise is not one of them.

I procrastinate just as much as the next person. Sometimes procrastination leads to skipping activities that I know I should be doing. Skip one day then the next day and before you know it, that habit I was trying to establish has disappeared.Â 

So I get it out of the way.
