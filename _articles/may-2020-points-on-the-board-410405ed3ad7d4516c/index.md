May was all about the primary job for me as working for two clients takes up a good chunk of my time.

*   I have decided to stop tracking my Facebook page for sleep. Maybe people just aren't that interested in the topic or maybe I'm doing it wrong. Either way, spending time on Facebook drains me. The point of launching that page was to learn about how to manage and promote a page and grow an audience for my upcoming book about sleep.
*   The upcoming book on sleep has had no progress. As I started to write it, I realized I was just writing another run-of-the-mill book about sleep and there are already plenty of those. This endeavor is on hold.
*   My podcast [The Brandonian Doctrine](https://anchor.fm/brandon-wilson99) is still going strong. I have published 58 episodes, and I've decided to stop posting episodes on weekends. It's a grueling pace to record and release a podcast episode every day regardless of how short they are. I think a new episode every weekday should suffice. I have no shortage of topics, and as I have said before I will keep doing it as long as I continue to enjoy the process. Maybe when I reach 100 episodes I'll have enough content to cut together a "best of" episode.
*   Project Strength [failed](https://cowriters.app/words/project-strength-failed-410155ed2bd2217f2e). I don't know whether failing counts as putting points on the board, but I'm adding it anyway.
*   I started an email marketing course to learn how to set up a landing page to capture emails and then craft offers to make money through email marketing. I am still in the researching a niche stage and have not built anything yet.Â 

No plans for June other than to keep chugging along.
