I work in the healthcare insurance industry, and we are trained from the very beginning about privacy laws and something called HIPAA, which governs how patient data is accessed, stored, and transmitted. The best practice I have without even thinking is locking my workstation every time I leave my desk.

Years ago I worked with a claims supervisor who was no-nonsense and took no prisoners. If one of his staff were acting up, he would give them a warning and then call them into a conference room or office to have it out with them. On extreme occasions, he would even take them to the Human Resources Department.Â 

One day I witnessed this in action. The supervisor had had enough. He locked his workstation pressing CTRL and ALT with his left hand, DELETE with his right hand, and ENTER for the finish to lock his workstation. He did it with such gusto that we coined the term "Triple-Click Mode" for these times when someone or something would set him off.

Those were the good ol' days. Nowadays when I work remote, it is a virtual workstation so I have to "send" CTRL-ALT-DELETE, robbing me of the satisfaction of going into a nostalgic Triple-Click Mode.
