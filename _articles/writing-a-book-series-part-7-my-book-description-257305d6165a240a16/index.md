I know I will improve this down the road. But for now this is what I have crafted for my book description.

Inadequate sleep is slowly killing you. You don’t have the energy you once did. You struggle to make better food choices and cannot lose weight and keep it off. You struggle to force yourself off the couch to exercise. You struggle with staying focused and remembering things. You know you should be operating much better physically and mentally.

Imagine waking up without an alarm, fully charged with energy that lasts the whole day. You actually want to exercise. You find it easy to eat healthy foods and are not tempted by junk food. Your mental focus sharpens. You feel like you did ten years ago.

If you don’t have a great diet, it’s difficult to change to a healthy one. If you don’t regularly exercise, it’s tough to establish an exercise routine. Don’t start with diet or exercise. Start with sleep.

Brandon reversed type 2 diabetes and eliminated all prescription medication by changing his diet and establishing an exercise routine. None of this would have been possible if he hadn’t started with optimizing his sleep. There are many behaviors and environmental factors that affect sleep, and this book provides the information you need to improve your sleep.
