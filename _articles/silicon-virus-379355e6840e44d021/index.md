My team is working on the coding requirements to update our system to process medical claims billed for screening/testing for COVID-19. For California and perhaps other states, there will be no cost to the members for these tests.

This morning I was informed by the COO at my client that based on guidance from the CDC, all future travel should be suspended until further notice. This will be my last week in San Jose for who knows how long.

Many tech companies have announced that employees will be working from home indefinitely. As of this afternoon, California has 157 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Santa Clara County, the epicenter of Silicon Valley, has 45 of these cases. Apple Park is 15 minutes away from my hotel. Netflix HQ is located in nearby Los Gatos. The headquarters for Paypal and eBay are right across the street from my office. 

At the end of the day, the CEO stopped by my office and actually apologized for "keeping you guys home." I was thinking to myself, "No...thank YOU!" I have so much more of my own time when I work from home. 

I understand that from a public health perspective, this virus needs to be taken seriously. There is more we don't know about COVID-19 than we do know.

Stay healthy out there.
