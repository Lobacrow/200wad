This is going to be a rant. If you enjoy my rants about #firstworldproblems then grab a beverage and settle in.

My doctor's office is moving to a new model of care. The primary doctor will still see patients in the office through insurance, but his availability will be very limited. He wants people to use virtual visits otherwise known as telehealth. The kicker is that virtual visits are cash-based and not through insurance. And it's not cheap! He is charging $33 per each 5-minute increment! A 15-minute visit would cost me $99, which is well above my usual $40 copay. I would have to pay the $99 upfront, submit a claim to my insurance company, and then fight with the doctor's office to get reimbursed for the amount I paid above the $40 copay.

By the way, I've never actually seen the main doctor at this office. I've always seen a physician assistant and that guy is no longer with the office. So, since I have to start back from square one anyway, it's time to find a new doctor.Â 

I am picky about selecting a doctor. I have had some bad experiences in the past, and I do not settle for the standard of care practiced by most doctors who are already reaching for the prescription pad before you've finished the sentence explaining your symptoms. Specifically, I want a doctor who practices an integrative approach (sometimes referred to as functional medicine). He or she needs to have the same view I do that type 2 diabetes is reversible and needs to be on board with the ketogenic diet.

It's not easy to find a doctor that meets my criteria. I found one relatively close and then saw the office hours:

Monday: Closed

Tuesday: 8AM - 5PM

Wednesday: Closed

Thursday: Closed

Friday: Closed

Saturday: 8AM - 2PM

Sunday: Closed

You're kidding right?? I'll pass on the cattle call that shows up on Tuesdays and Saturdays.

I may have found a doctor who meets my criteria but I need to do more research.

Don't get me wrong. I know there are many places in the world with a dearth of proper medical care and that is awful. I'm grateful to live in the US and have access to all that we have. But the system is broken.
