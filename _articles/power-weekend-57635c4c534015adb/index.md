This weekend I am in Birmingham, Alabama. I am here for what I like to call a "Power Weekend." The company with which I am affiliated offers four major training events each year. This is my third event since joining in June of 2018.

The events have activities all day Saturday and all day Sunday. There is a mixture of talks from company executives, trainers, and recognition. There is training on nuts and bolts related to the business, but the majority of the focus is personal development. 

As someone who went from virtually no personal development to being virtually bathed in it, I can tell you it's a game changer.

You can read books. You can listen to podcasts. You can watch YouTube videos. This is all good stuff, but there is no substitute for experiencing the energy and community of attending a live event. When you go all-in at a live event, it changes you in the moment and can lead to lasting results. 

If you are interested in improving yourself, I strongly suggest that you find a personal development training event to attend in person. Yes there will be a cost to attend the event itself, to travel to the event, and to stay in a hotel or airbnb. There is also the cost of time as you devote your entire weekend to this endeavor. This is a "Power Weekend," and it has the power to change your life. It has certainly changed mine.
