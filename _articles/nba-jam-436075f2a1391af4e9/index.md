It's been six days since I took delivery of one of the greatest arcade games of all time--at least Arcade 1Up's version of the game known as NBA Jam. In reality, it's actually three games in one: NBA Jam, NBA Jam Tournament Edition, and NBA Hang Time.  

I've already played 51 games, which would have been $102 dollars had I been pumping quarters into the arcade game. I'm already at 25% of recouping my investment, but it's not about the money. I usually play the computer because online play hasn't quite smoothed out yet. I've had a couple of good games online, but they are few and far between. 

I am happy to say the magic is still there. This game is like a time machine that takes me all the way back to high school. I wish my friends were around to play with me. They all are pretending to have families or other obligations and not a one of them has bought the game yet. 

My fingers and wrists are certainly getting a workout, and the game is a welcome reprieve from stress at work and the general malaise brought on by the state of the world right now.
