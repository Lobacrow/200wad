> Whenever the immune system deals successfully with an infection, it emerges from the experience stronger and better able to confront similar threats in the future. Our immune competence develops in combat. If at the first sign of infection you always jump in with antibiotics, you do not give the system a chance to test itself and grow stronger. --Andrew Weil

The immune system carries out two primary functions: defense and tolerance. The immune system defends against external invaders such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites. It also patrols the body for internal issues such as cancer cells. It also regulates your level of tolerance to potential environmental triggers such as allergens like pollen, bee stings, grasses, wheat, peanuts, soy, dairy, etc.

The Four Primary Immune System Functions

1.  Defense against external environment. If it fails, you get an infection.
2.  Defense against internal environment. If it fails, you get cancer.
3.  Tolerance against external environment. If it fails, you get allergies.
4.  Tolerance against internal environment. If it fails, you get an autoimmune disease.

When the body's immune system is impaired, it can turn on you and attack and destroy your own healthy tissues by mistake, resulting in an autoimmune disorder. There are more than 100 different autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and type 1 diabetes. These disorders affect 80 million Americans, and more than 75% of those suffering from an autoimmune disease are women.

Having an autoimmune disease is associated with an increased risk for mood disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, ADD/ADHD, and dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

Scientists don't know the exact causes of autoimmune disorders, but there many factors that can play a role in their development:

*   Leaky gut
*   Environmental allergens such as pollen, dust mites, mold
*   Food allergens such as dairy, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soybeans (top 8 allergens according to the FDA)
*   Toxins
*   Obesity
*   Head trauma
*   Lack of exercise or excessive exercise
*   Poor diet
*   Nutrient deficiencies
*   Stress
*   Sleep disorders
*   Hidden infections

Infectious illnesses are a major cause of mental health issues that few medical professionals recognize. 

What do cats have in common with the following?

Alzheimer's disease

Anxiety

Bipolar disorder

Depression

Impulsive behavior

Schizophrenia

Suicidal thoughts

Answer: _Toxoplasma gondii._ This tiny, single-celled parasite is often carried in cats and shed in their feces. The parasite can lead to an infection called toxoplasmosis, which has a strong association with mental illness. 

Fungal infections can also impact brain health. What makes us more vulnerable to fungal infections?

*   Weakened immune system
*   Taking immunosuppressant medication
*   Taking antibiotics or oral contraceptives
*   High alcohol intake
*   Consuming a diet high in sugar and refined carbohydrates
*   Consuming a lot of fermented foods
*   High stress levels
*   Uncontrolled diabetes
*   Mercury toxicity

Your vulnerability to illness depends on many factors--the strength of your immune system, the level of exposure, stress, and daily habits.

**My Action Steps:**

*   Continue to get regular blood tests to monitor risks for infections. This includes a complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), antinuclear antibodies (ANA), and vitamin D levels. Vitamin D levels, in particular, are closely tied to the health of the immune system.
*   Lower stress by performing daily meditation and having a relaxing bedtime routine
*   Avoid toxoplasmosis by carefully cleaning the cat litter box. I have an automated litter box that minimizes any contact I would have with waste material. I also avoid stray cats, which have a higher likelihood of being infected.
*   Emphasize foods that contain immune system-enhancing nutrients such as garlic, anthocyanins, echinacea, probiotics, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, and Zinc.
