When you start learning something new, one of the natural questions to ask is how long will it take to get good?

The answer is that it is entirely up to you. Perhaps start by asking a different question.

When I graduated from college and started teaching junior high students, I had limited experience speaking in front of groups. In fact, I was terrible at public speaking. But I had to get really good really fast as a teacher. I learned the hard way what happens when you lose control of thirty pubescent teenagers. Let's call it on-the-job training.

In addition to learning by doing, I watched veteran teachers. I asked lots of questions. I learned by trial and error. I learned fast because I had to and because I put in the hours every day consistently. 

Years ago I watched an [infomercial](https://youtu.be/LEEue6riAK4) where the artist Esteban was offering an acoustic guitar and video lessons. I got sucked in and bought the guitar. I had no prior musical experience except a few organ lessons when I was in grade school. My plan was to practice once or twice a week. It didn't last long. I discovered I do not have a natural ability to play guitar. My fingers constantly hurt because of how hard I had to press the strings. I never practiced for a long enough time to develop calluses. My hands and fingers are built for typing on a keyboard not playing the guitar. I didn't want it bad enough. And practicing at the rate of once or twice a week meant it would take a VERY long time to get good at playing the guitar. 

If you want to learn a new skill, don't ask how long it will take to get good. Ask how long you want it to take. Then make a plan to show up and put in the hours consistently to make it happen.

It is funny to look back at this post and apply the logic to my current endeavor of strength training. I'm fine with taking a long time to add muscle and improve overall metabolic health. I'm not in a hurry. I'm not training for some event or competition. I want to avoid injury, and I also want to avoid pain.

Unfortunately, no pain no gain. There is pain because muscle fibers are literally being torn apart in the process. Little did I know that there would be a delayed reaction. The day after my first workout I was sore. But it wasn't as bad as I expected it to be and I was rather upbeat. Then came day 2. When I woke up and got out of bed I almost collapsed to the floor. My legs were absolutely wrecked. The front and back of my thighs (to use laymen's terms) were on fire. And I am supposed to do the full work out again?? It didn't happen.

I'm going to have a conversation with my trainer tomorrow about this approach she outlined for me. The problem with trainers is that usually they are used to working out and have always been fit. They don't understand the perspective of someone who is completely out of shape and is starting at square one. Or maybe they are masochists and love pain and want you to experience it too.

I have the mindset now that I am not going to give up. That doesn't mean I won't figure out a better way to accomplish my goal. And hopefully less pain.
