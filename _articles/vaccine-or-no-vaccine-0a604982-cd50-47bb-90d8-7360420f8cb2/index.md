One of the highlights from the VP debate last night was Senator Kamala Harriss's response about a COVID vaccine. She said that if the health experts recommend taking the vaccine, she would be the first in line to take it. But if Donald Trump recommends the vaccine, she will not get it. Vice President Pence chided her for what he called an irresponsible view toward vaccines.

The decision to get the COVID vaccine when it is available is not a slam dunk to me. I have never gotten the flu vaccine. I generally follow the approach to let the body naturally fight off sickness. From a population health perspective, vaccines are a good thing. That's why doctors and health professionals will always tell the masses to get vaccinated. On an individual basis, the decision becomes more nuanced. There are risks with every type of treatment. 

Do you really think that this vaccine that was raced through experimentation and clinical trials at "warp speed" will be safe? As I noted in my newsletter on sleep, if you have a poor night of sleep prior to getting a vaccine, the effectiveness is greatly reduced. 

I think the decision to get the vaccine yourself or recommend it to loved ones is a decision not to be taken lightly.
