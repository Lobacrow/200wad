I've had my MacBook since it came out in 2017. It's been a great laptop save for one glaring flaw--the keyboard. I'm not alone in my opinion. Apple admitted as much by redesigning the keyboard in the latest MacBook Pro, calling it the magic keyboard. I don't know what's so magic about it, but the reviews indicate the design has been much improved.  

I type A LOT. Even though I'm not traveling now, I still prefer to use my laptop. After spending 10+ hours sitting at a computer (a PeeCee no less), the last thing I want to do is sit in front of my iMac. I'd rather grab my laptop and chill out on the couch.

Fast forward to last month when Apple introduced a shiny new MacBook Air. Yes, it has all the usual bells and whistles for a new Apple laptop, and most importantly it has the magic keyboard! I suppose could I have waited for the MacBook Pro 13", which is due for a refresh (and most likely magic keyboard) in a couple of months, but I have never had a Pro laptop. I don't need to spend the money on all that power.

I decided to see how much my three-year-old MacBook would be worth to trade in. I went with Apple's third-party option, and I was able to get $480 credit. That made the decision easy for me. I boxed up my MacBook last week and just received my Apple store gift card today. Within minutes, I had ordered the shiny new space gray MacBook Air. 

I would normally pick it up, but the Apple stores are all closed. The new toy is scheduled to arrive April 17-24. Always great looking forward to a new Apple product.

4-20-20

Every day is a great day when a shiny new Apple product arrives at my door. Today my new MacBook Air was delivered. I was surprised that UPS still requires a signature with a device that I had to touch. I promptly washed my hands before the grand unveiling.

The timeline wasn't too bad all things considered. I mailed my previous MacBook on Tuesday, 3/29, and the trade-in company confirmed receipt on Friday, 4/3. On Thursday, 4/9 my trade-in was accepted, and I received the electronic Apple Store gift card. I promptly ordered my new toy. Start to finish it was about three weeks.

Without question the keyboard has been vastly improved. There is more travel with the keys, and there is a dampened sound compared to the previous clickety clack. I haven't had much time to use it yet because it took almost six hours to restore it from the back-up. I really need to do some spring cleaning on all my files.

The trackpad is as smooth as always. I think it might have been fashioned out of pure ghee. TouchID is definitely welcome. I will be playing on it a bit more this evening, but then it's night night time. Yes, sleep wins even above a fancy new toy.
