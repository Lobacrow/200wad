For those of you who have been following Project Food as Fuel, I have an update to share. For the uninitiated, you can get caught up with [this post](https://200wordsaday.com/words/project-food-as-fuel-166515cd04215d04c0).Â 

Things are going to get a bit technical. For the TLDR folks, I'm reversing !#%!#$ diabetes!

Let's get right to the results. I will report my result in March with my result in August.

Fasting glucose - amount of glucose (sugar) circulating in the blood

Normal range: 65 - 99

Pre-diabetes: 100 - 125

Type 2 diabetes: Above 125

**My result: March: 134 --> August: 118**

Hemoglobin a1C - average glucose level for the previous three months

Normal range: Below 5.7

Pre-diabetes: Between 5.7 and 6.5

Type 2 diabetes: Above 6.5

**My result: March: 5.4 --> August: 5.1**

Insulin - amount of hormone circulating in the blood

Normal range: 2.6 - 24.9

**My result: March: 15.1 --> August: 10.4**

Triglycerides - amount of fat circulating in the blood

Normal range: 0 - 149

**My result: March: 160 --> August: 115**

C-Reactive Protein - Measure of systemic inflammation in the body

Normal range: 0 - 3. This is a predictor of risk for a future cardiac event based on the following:

<1: low risk

1 - 3: Average risk

\>3: High risk

**My result: March: 4.85 --> August: 2.73**

Without question for biomarkers related specifically to diabetes, I have achieved excellent results WITHOUT prescription medications. If I compare the results to the test in September of 2018 when I was diagnosed, the difference is even more striking.

There are a few concerns on the report, the most glaring is cholesterol. My cholesterol was high before and while HDL (good cholesterol) has gone up and LDL (bad cholesterol) has gone down, I'm still outside of what are considered healthy ranges. This topic deserves a post all by itself. I intend to do a deep dive on the subject of cholesterol including addressing the myths around it and then determine what I need to do (if anything) to make sure I am in the proper ranges to minimize cardiovascular issues.

It is great to have positive results to demonstrate that the actions I'm taking are getting me closer to my goal. Thanks for taking the journey with me. More to come.
