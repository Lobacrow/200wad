No it isn't!? Well I suppose it depends on when you are reading this post. I'm writing this on December 8th yet I'm saying today is January 1st. Here is why.

Every year around November and December people tend to get caught up in the holidays. People are spending more time focusing on family, perhaps taking vacations, and focusing on Thanksgiving and Christmas. I'm not saying these things are bad. The problem is that this can lead people to get complacent.

I continue to hear this phrase or some variation of it: "Well, once we get through the holidays, THEN I will start on X, Y, Z..." How many people wait until January 2nd (of course not January 1st because many will be hung over) to get started on resolutions and working on goals. Why wait? 

It's like the addict who wants one last night/weekend of partying before going to rehab. 

Or the people wanting to lose weight who gain 10 pounds between Thanksgiving and Christmas making it that much more difficult.

If you have already made the decision and committed yourself to taking action, then today is January 1st. The calendar has nothing to do with it.

Don't use the holidays or the calendar as an excuse not to start a new endeavor. In fact, if you start now you will have a head start that will give you momentum in January and from there the sky is the limit.
