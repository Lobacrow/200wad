We are living in a world full of noise. This is especially true in the US considering our current President. At this point when someone tells me something about Trump, my response is usually, "It's just that guy from _The Apprentice_."

On one hand it is irresponsible to ignore everything and be ignorant about what's going on in the world around you. On the other hand, to be an informed citizen takes a significant amount of time as you wade through the news to filter what is important. 

Another key part of the discussion is the difference between being a content consumer and a content producer. Most people start out as consumers, and the shift to become a producer is difficult. They say the best way to become a good writer is to read a lot, but what is the balance between how much time reading vs. how much time writing?

Just as you should get good at something worth getting good at, so too you should consume content that is beneficial to you. Consider how much news you are consuming and what value it brings to your life. Maybe you are due for an audit of what you are watching and reading and listening to. 

Finally, one small suggestion. If you want a clever summary of news without all the noise, I recommend the Morning Brew daily email. morningbrew.com/?kid=3ff4b9
