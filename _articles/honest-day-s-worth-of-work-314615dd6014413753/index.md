Today I was at the office before 7 AM and didn't leave until after 6 PM. Ten-, eleven-, even twelve-hour days are not unheard of for a consultant. I know some people put in even more hours, but I draw the line at half the day.

Some days you feel like you really earned your keep. I have heard people refer to this as an "honest day's worth of work." Today was one of those days for me.

Do you suppose a career thief gets home at the end of the day and says, "You know, that was a _dishonest_ day's worth of work."

Tomorrow is a travel day. This means it will be an abbreviated workday, but it will be a long day nonetheless. I will be awake prior to 5 AM and will arrive home from the airport after 9 PM. Thankfully, Friday will be a light day since I will have completed most of my hours for the week.

All this while trying to keep stress levels in check and to remain in nutritional ketosis. I am looking forward to a massage on Friday and a stretch appointment on Saturday.Â 

At least next week is a short week.
