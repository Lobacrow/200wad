This week I'm on a road trip across the great USA. I am traveling from Arizona (southwest region of US) to North Carolina (East Coast). I'm not in a hurry on this trip. There will be full days of driving but stops in different cities along the way. I started on Tuesday and will arrive in my destination on Friday. I suppose this is my own brief stint as a nomad before returning to the normal routine.

It's been a long time since I have taken a multi-day road trip. I know this because the last big road trip I took across the country involved planning and organizing my CD collection. What a quaint idea to have a limited number of CDs to listen to on a road trip! This road trip I have zero CDs, which have been replaced by my iPhone and various podcasts and of course Apple Music.

Sometimes you need a change of pace to mix things up. At the same time, there are certain habits like writing every day that I do not want to miss just because I'm traveling. Of course I'm not writing this post while driving.Â 

I'll be in Amarillo, Texas in a couple hours. It's a great day for a drive.
