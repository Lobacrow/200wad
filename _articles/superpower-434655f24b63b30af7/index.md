I was in a meeting today and for some reason decided to grab a pen and attempt to write some notes. It didn't go well.

I don't take pen to paper much at all anymore. As a result, it feels weird to write now. It seems very slow to me, and if I don't concentrate it will be an illegible mess. 

I also have an aversion to dictation. In order to get the most accurate transcription, you have to speak slowly and enunciate clearly. Then you have to go back and correct all the mistakes. 

Contrast writing or dictating with typing in which I can type over 100 WPM with great accuracy. Why write or dictate when I can type? 

Typing is my superpower. 

I saw someone typing notes in a meeting today and recognized someone else with this superpower. Usually, the meeting facilitator is not also the note-taker, but there are some of us who can do both.

And when you combine superpowers, that's when the real magic happens. I can combine fast typing with the well-exercised muscle of writing. No wonder I can churn out emails and documents like they are going out of style (or I'm running out of time).
