A couple of times a week I usually get an IM that starts with, "Hey quick question..."

I suppose people think that asking in this way will somehow increase the likelihood that I will respond. That's fine if it's a quick question, but what if the answer is long? That's still a bad deal for the person answering the question. Perhaps they should say, "Hey quick question and I'm sure easy/short answer..."

"What's the purpose of life?" Quick question, indeed.

Language matters. I saw a posting in the Next Door app where a fellow neighbor was looking for a "good cardiologist." Is it necessary to use the word "good?" Isn't it implied that if you are looking for a cardiologist, you want at the very least a good one? How does one choose a cardiologist or any other type of doctor anyway? You have to assume that if it's a board-certified doctor, that you shouldn't need to worry about his or her credentials. I suppose it boils down to what is referred to as bedside manner. In other words, personality.Â 

When you finally pick that cardiologist, you can open with a quick question: "Hey doc, am I going to have a heart attack?"
