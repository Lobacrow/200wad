Recently I listened to an [episode of Joe Rogan's podcast](https://youtu.be/BEWz4SXfyCQ) in which he interviews Bob Lazar. I had never heard the name, but apparently Bob Lazar is quite well known in the UFO community based on information he has shared over the years. 

Bob indicates that he has a master's degree in physics from MIT, and a master's degree in electronic technology from Caltech. Curiously, there are no records to support his attendance at either institution. 

Bob started his career at Los Alamos National Lab, of which there is documentation to support his employment. It seems odd that this lab would hire someone without a college education, which makes the absence of college records all the more interesting. Bob contends that his school record was wiped on purpose.

In the late 80's, Bob Lazar says he worked at an Air Force facility called "S-4" near the famous Area 51 in Nevada. While working at this facility, Bob saw nine spacecraft that purportedly came from extra terrestrial origins. He was allowed to walk inside one and investigate it, and he witnessed the craft take flight on multiple occasions. 

Bob's job was to reverse engineer a reactor the likes of which he had never seen or known to be within the realm of physics. The reactor produced energy in the form of a gravity wave using a fuel known as E115. It wasn't until years later that scientific proof confirmed that gravity waves exist, and the element E115 was added to the periodic table as moscovium.

I don't know what to make of Bob's story. He certainly sounds credible and does not come off as a crackpot. If what he says is true, alien life exists and there are people within the US government who know about it. If alien life exists, it would not surprise me as that possibility has always been more believable to me than the fact that in this vast universe the earth is the only planet with intelligent life. 

If you have any interest in the subject matter, I recommend that you listen to the episode. There is also a Netflix documentary, but between the two I think the podcast is more interesting.
