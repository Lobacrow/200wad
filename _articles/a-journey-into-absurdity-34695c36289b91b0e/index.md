Every once in a while an idea occurs to me that makes me chuckle. Usually, it is something completely absurd. I thought I would share one of those with you today to give you a peek into how my mind sometimes works.

The idea that makes me chuckle is a "thong diaper." I don't know why I thought of this phrase. No matter how you frame it, it's completely absurd.

First of all, there are two types of people who typically wear diapers: babies and elderly people with incontinence problems. The whole point of a diaper is to capture bodily outputs, and the last thing you want is any type of leakage. Why would a diaper be created as a thong? This completely defeats the purpose.

Second, let's talk about thongs for a moment. Thongs are typically worn by women who are of a certain age and let's say a certain body type (thoughÂ of course there are exceptions.) Thongs apparently eliminate panty lines for certain types of clothes, and they might be regarded by some as a sexy form of lingerie. Again, none of these characteristics share anything in common with diapers.

Who knows, maybe there is some dark corner of the internet where fetishists have created thong diapers and are using them in ways I never imagined. I was too scared to go look. I still think the idea is absurd, which is why it makes me chuckle.
