Here's an idea. I'm wondering why it hasn't been done yet.

Shouldn't we have the technology that offers the option to record a virtual meeting, transcribe the meeting, and send it to all participants after the meeting?

Now why don't we have this? Is it because voice recognition isn't good enough yet? Is it because none of the pre-eminent virtual meeting services are willing to offer it and a start-up doesn't want to enter a crowded space?
