As Leonardo DiCaprio's character stated in _Django Unchained_, "You _had_ my curiosity but now you _have_ my attention."

Your internal dialog or internal programming is extremely powerful. Every word, action, and thought enters into your subconscious mind and produces either a negative or a positive result. The subconscious mind completely controls your success because it is so much more powerful than your conscious mind.

Dr. Phil points out that on average we speak at a rate of 125 words per minute, but we think thoughts at a rate of 1200-1400 words per minute. Our thoughts are **ten times more powerful**!

As motivation speaker Matt Morris talks about in the book _The Unemployed Millionaire_:

> The most difficult thing in the world for people to change is their identity, because it's who they believe they are. There's an important law of human nature called consistency that states we have a natural urge and tendency to remain consistent with who we think we are.

For example, if someone has programmed his or her identity to be overweight, then consciously that person may want to get thin but subconsciously that person's mind believes he or she is an overweight person. The subconscious mind will do whatever it can to keep your identity consistent with what you believe.

Another trick is that the subconscious mind does not know the difference between a truth and a lie. It just works to carry out exactly what you have become programmed to believe. 

"I just can't lose weight." - Of course not when you tell yourself that!

"I have never been able to remember people's names." -Well, that's never going to change if you keep believing it!

"I am bad with money." -Whether or not it's true, stop saying it to yourself!

The key is to constantly fill your subconscious mind with empowering, uplifting, and motivating thoughts. Don't focus on what you don't want or what you don't have or what you aren't. 

Here is a practical example that applies to goal setting and illustrates why language is so powerful.

"My goal is to be a millionaire." 

What's wrong with this goal? The problem is the way it is worded. When you say, "I want to be a millionaire," it implies that you are NOT a millionaire and guess what else knows that? The subconscious mind. So the best intentions of having a goal are on shaky ground from the start because of language and mindset. 

So, what would be a better way to phrase the goal? You want to be specific, of course, so add a timeline and means for achieving the goal. 

**"I _am_ a millionaire by the age of 50 through selling my products and services."**

Is this true? It doesn't matter. The subconscious is going to act on what you believe.

I have several goals written in this way on index cards that I review at night before I go to sleep. 

"Oh well that's just wishful thinking." 

Have you ever noticed people who say that aren't very positive or successful? 

I have much more to say on the topic, but my time is up for today.
