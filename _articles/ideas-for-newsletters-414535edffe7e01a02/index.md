I am doing a thought experiment. Suppose I were to create an email newsletter. What would be the topic?

The challenge for me is to stay on topic. With a newsletter, the standard advice is you need a narrow topic to get the right audience. I would need to pick a topic that will keep me interested for the long term. I would also want to pick a topic that pulls in a wide enough audience that I can get some traction going to eventually monetize it.

So, James Altucher style, let me write down ten ideas for email newsletters.

1.  Sleep tips
2.  Low carb/keto strategies/products/food ideas
3.  Brain health hacks
4.  Tips and strategies for people who hate exercise and vegetables but want to be healthy
5.  Biohacking on a budget
6.  The non-news news - stories that are not found on any mainstream media
7.  Fun with words - English words or phrases including origins, fun facts, and appropriate use
8.  Nutrition ammunition - Reading food labels and understanding healthy and non-healthy ingredients
9.  Practical positive thinking
10.  Engaging gadgets - Favorite gadgets with reviews

I think the topic of sleep tips is too narrow and would perhaps be better as a subtopic of a larger overall health focus. I'm thinking about using the low carb/keto niche as I am working through the email marketing course. I feel like I continue to return to the health-related topics and that just might be the direction to go.
