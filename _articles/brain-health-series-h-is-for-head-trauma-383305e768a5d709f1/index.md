The brain is soft, about the consistency of soft butter or tofu. It floats in cerebrospinal fluid and is housed in a very hard skull that has many sharp, bony ridges. Even though the skull protects the brain, the brain can still be damaged internally. 

After physical trauma, the brain experiences the following:

*   bruising
*   broken blood vessels and bleeding
*   increased pressure
*   lack of oxygen
*   damage to nerve cell connections
*   Fracture of brain cells that causes inflammatory reactions

Head injuries increase the risk of the following:

*   Depression
*   Anxiety and panic disorders
*   Psychosis
*   PTSD
*   Suicide
*   Drug and alcohol abuse
*   ADD/ADHD
*   Learning problems
*   Borderline and antisocial personality disorders
*   Dementia
*   Aggression
*   Homelessness
*   Victimization
*   Loss of or changes in sense of smell or taste

Irlen syndrome is a visual processing problem that tends to run in families and is common after traumatic brain injury. Anyone experiencing symptoms of anxiety, irritability, depression, or decreased concentration should be screened for it. You can find more information [here](https://irlen.com/what-is-irlen-syndrome/). 

Thankfully, I did not play contact sports when I was younger. I also do not recall any incidents of traumatic brain injury. Many of the tips in this chapter center around what to do if you've had a traumatic brain injury. Nevertheless, I want to protect my brain from any future trauma.

**My Action Steps**

*   Always wear my seat belt in a car.
*   Don't text while driving or walking.
*   Wear a helmet while biking. Shame on me for not having a helmet, but I will be purchasing one.
*   Avoid high-risk behaviors that expose me to head trauma. That's an easy one for me. That's like George Carlin's joke about boarding an airplane. "Ladies and gentlemen, it is now time to get on the plane." ON the plane? I'm getting IN the plane. Seems to be far less wind in there. Let Evil Knievel get ON the plane.
*   Practice balance exercises to ensure a strong core and maintain agility
