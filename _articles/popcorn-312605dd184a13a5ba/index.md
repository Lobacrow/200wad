I like popcorn. I have an old-fashioned popcorn machine that cranks out popcorn movie-theater style. I use coconut oil and when I get the right amount of salt it is sublime. Some people use an air popper, but that leads to popcorn that is too close to styrofoam for my tastes. Microwave popcorn is simply not good for you, and you should avoid it.

Sadly, like many treats, I need to give up popcorn. Popcorn is like chips and the maker of Pringles knows "you can't just eat one." If I don't limit myself, I can eat a whole big bowl of popcorn. That's what I did last night, and I paid for it. My continuous glucose monitor showed a spike over 150, then a higher spike, then a higher spike that reached about 180. Even without eating dinner, my glucose remained above my high target of 125 through the night and into the morning.

But everything in moderation right? Rather than give it up completely, why not just have a handful of popcorn and that's it? That's tough to do. If you have a sweet tooth, you know how hard it is to have just one treat. The body and brain get that hit of sugar and then the reward center in the brain with a rebel yell cries "More more more!"Â 

No more popcorn for awhile. I'll put it in the same category as chips, which I have given up for over six months. Popcorn is the wrong fuel for me regardless of how much I enjoy it.
