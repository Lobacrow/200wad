I am booked to attend the [Upgrade Labs 7th Annual Biohacking Conference in Beverly Hills, CA](https://xp2020.upgradelabs.com/home?utm_source=google&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=8675505752&utm_content=418079522115&utm_term=biohacking%20conference). This event is organized by Mr. Bulletproof himself, Dave Asprey. This is the first time I am attending the event, and I can't wait to hear the latest and greatest from experts in various fields.

I received two separate emails with exclusive offers for attendees, and I'm amazed by all the companies and products that will be represented.

Bioptomizers.com - I just bought a comprehensive magnesium supplement from them.

Braintap.com - Some type of app that provides audio for brainwave training. This sounds interesting and is worth exploring.

Chilitechnology.com - I've had my eye on the chilipad for a while, and I just might have to take advantage of the discount to get the new version called the Ooler. This is a pad filled with water that you place on your mattress. It is attached to a circulator that either heats or cools the water to a specified temperature set on the app. Of course, if it is something that improves sleep, I'm in!

Saminasleep.com - This does not look like your average mattress company. I don't need a new mattress, but I might be interested in some of the other products. 

Neuvanalife.com - Another brain-stimulating device focused on the vagus nerve for relaxation and improved sleep. Ahhhh another one to put on the list!

Tripp.com - A virtual reality headgear and app combination to reduce stress and calm the mind.

Hapbee.com - A device you wear around your neck that uses low-energy magnetic fields to somehow alter your emotional state. I already did a pre-order for this one on Indiegogo even though I swore off using that site and Kickstarter previously.

Theragun.com - There are so many of these devices. I got a deal on a similar one for Christmas, and it works well on tired muscles. 

Quicksilverscientific.com - Lots of high-powered supplements and the ones for keto and sleep caught my eye.

Somavedic.com - Protection from EMF. This is certainly something I want to explore in more detail.

Biohacking.comosystems.com - More EMF protection. The traveler piece was in Dave Asprey's last biohacking box, and I carry it with me when I travel.

Superfat.com - Nice collection of nut butters, although I had my fill of them when I started the keto diet and taking a break from them.

Jadeleafmatcha.com - I've been trying to transition into drinking tea with little success. Maybe I should dive in with matcha.

Haloneuro.com - Another brain stimulator. This one is focused on improving muscle memory and physical performance.

Lakanto.com - Keto-friendly monk fruit sweetener and products. This sounds like something I need to add to my pantry.

Lifecykel.com - I'm not a fan of eating mushrooms, but I know certain ones have a host of benefits. I have heard of Four Sigmatic, and I will have to compare those products to these and see which ones I'd like to try.
