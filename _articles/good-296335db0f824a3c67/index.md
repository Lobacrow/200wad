It's a word we say all the time, and most of the time we don't even think about it.

"Hey Bob, how are you today?"

"Good!"

I'm talking about a different use of the word good.

*   You didn't get the job. Good.
*   You were passed over for a promotion. Good.
*   You lost a customer. Good.
*   You got yelled at by your boss. Good.
*   You had an unexpected expense. Good
*   Your website stopped being ranked page 1 on Google. Good.
*   You got injured. Good.

Life doesn't happen to you. Life happens for you.

Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.

Failure is temporary. Setbacks are momentary.

Disappointment is a temporary emotion, not a permanent perspective.

How you handle disappointments will directly affect the quality of your life and the condition of your heart.

Never make a permanent decision with a temporary mindset.

The same things that crush unsuccessful people motivate successful people.

It'll all work out in the end, and if it's not working out it's not the end.

Be grateful for the opportunities to grow and become the person you dream to be.Â 

The next time things don't go your way or you have bad luck or you think the deck is stacked against you, you know what to say.

Good.
