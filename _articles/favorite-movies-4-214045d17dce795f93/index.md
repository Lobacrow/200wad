The next movie on my list was released in 1995. I suppose the genre would be gangster comedy. The cast is stellar. John Travolta, Danny DeVito, Gene Hackman,  and Rene Russo as the main characters. I'm talking about the movie _Get Shorty_.

John Travolta has had plenty of hits and misses, but for me one of his hits is his role as the gangster Chili Palmer. Perhaps riding his resurgent fame from _Pulp Fiction_ (released one year earlier), Travolta maintains his coolness throughout the movie as a gangster who wants to leave criminal life and get into the movie business. 

Gene Hackman also has a memorable performance as a movie producer/director whose best days are behind him. Danny DeVito has some great scenes portraying the fictional actor Martin Weir. Another great character is Ray "Bones" Barboni portrayed brilliantly by the late Dennis Farina. Of course, I have to also mention James Gandolfini as the movie stuntman Bear before he became famous as Tony Soprano.

The movie has a great cast of characters with a plot that keeps you interested until the end. 

A sequel called _Be Cool_ was released in 2005. John Travolta and Danny DeVito are the only two original cast members to reprise their roles. _Be Cool_ has its moments (The Rock portraying a flamboyant gay guy comes to mind), but it cannot compare to the brilliance of _Get Shorty_.
