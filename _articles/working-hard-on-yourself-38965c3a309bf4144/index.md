I know a lot of hard workers. They put in many hours at the office, often without getting any extra pay for any hours worked beyond 40 in a week. These same people also work hard for others. They take care of their families. They are the first ones willing to help a friend in need. These are great people with good intentions. The problem is that they are so focused on working hard and helping everyone else that they neglect themselves.

Imagine if people worked just as hard on themselves as they do for a job or for others? What do I mean by working on yourself?

*   Working on your mind - Through reading, learning, meditating, practicing gratitude, or any other personal development activities  
    
*   Working on your body - Through healthy eating and physical activity  
    
*   Working on your spirituality - Refining and connecting with something greater than yourself including religious or spiritual practices

Yes, it sounds selfish. Our society criticizes what is deemed as selfish behavior. But in order to truly give and impact lives, you have to be in a good place to do that. As the pre-flight message goes, "In case of a loss in cabin pressure, put on your mask first before helping others."

It is worth the effort to work on yourself. Don't think of it as selfish. Think of it as improving your mind, body, and spirit. When you improve yourself, you automatically improve your abilities to work and help others.
