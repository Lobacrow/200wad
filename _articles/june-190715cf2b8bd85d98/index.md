We all do it. Let's get the obligatory "time flies" exasperations out of the way.

_"Wow, May went by fast!"_

_"I can't believe it's June already!"_

_"The year is almost half over!"_

OK. Did you get it out of your system? Good. The more time we waste doing that, the less time we have to take action. Rather than reflect on how _tempus fugit_, I like to reflect for a moment on accomplishments as I pivot to the month ahead.

Reflecting on my accomplishments in May, there are two that come to mind.

1\. Completed one month of Project Food as Fuel. I am no longer taking any prescription medication. I have been in nutritional ketosis for over one month. My body is adapting to this new process. There are ups and downs in terms of weight, sleep quality, and energy. Overall, I feel like I am moving in the right direction.Â 

2\. I started proceeding through Module 1 of the Knowledge Business Blueprint training course that I purchased from Tony Robbins and Dean Graziosi. Without question, this course was a wise investment for me. These guys had big promises, and they have managed to over-deliver. I'm learning so much about myself and about the process used to develop a knowledge business. I am definitely in the right category.

Okay, June. You're not going to fly by on my watch. I've got another successful month on tap and ready to go.
