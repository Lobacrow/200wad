I'm a math major. When I graduated from college I joined a program called Teach for America and taught junior high for two years. After that, I had to figure out what to do for a career. Then 9/11 happened and I was jobless for several months. After applying at seven different temp agencies, I finally got a placement at a health insurance company. Not because I knew anything about medical claims, but because I am a fast typer. Eighteen years later I am in the same industry.
