As a rule, I don't go to movie theaters very often. I reserve these occasions for movies that deserve to be seen on the big screen and with surround sound. The last movie I saw in the theater was _Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,_ which I'm sure all Tarantino fans have already seen.

I wanted to see what all the fuss was about for _1917_ and the new Alamo Drafthouse that opened up near my house. This is one of those theaters that serves a full menu including beer. I'm not a huge fan of the concept since I do not want my viewing experience constantly interrupted, but the servers do a good job of staying out of the way. They also served popcorn with clarified butter, which is always a plus.

This is a movie set during WWI and follows the journey of two soldiers on a mission through enemy lines to deliver an important message to another company of men fighting the Germans. The most striking aspect of this movie is that it is shot as if it were one continuous take. It does not have edits and cuts and changes in camera angles like a traditional movie. This technique is used to great effect and makes you feel like you are a third person following the soldiers on their journey. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and give this movie the nod of approval to be seen in a movie theater.

At the 2020 Academy Awards, this movie had ten nominations including Best Picture and Best Director, and it won three Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects.
