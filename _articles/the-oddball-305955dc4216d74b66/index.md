When I am onsite in California, I walk from the hotel to the office and back to the hotel. I only skip the walk when it's raining, which thankfully is not very often. The walk is almost exactly one mile, practically as the crow flies. Initially, this choice was to avoid the swirl of coordination around the shared rental cars and timing. The reality is that the walks are far more important for me physically and mentally.

I sit at a computer most of the day. A brisk walk gets the heart pumping, and while not a substitute for full-blown exercise, it is nevertheless better than no activity. 

The daylight saving time change this week has been a big help. When I'm walking to work around 6:30 AM PST I can catch the sunrise. When I'm walking back to the hotel around 5:00 PM PST I can catch the sunset. I delve into great detail in Chapters 6 and 7 in my upcoming book about circadian rhythms and the effect of sunlight on sleep. The headline is that you should try to get exposure to sunlight, especially during sunrise and sunset so that your body can synchronize your circadian rhythm. Of course, this applies if you have a normal day schedule and are not a shift worker. Who knew that getting exposure to the sunrise helps with your sleep that very night? 

I also use my walks to catch up on podcasts or audiobooks. This practice allows me to mentally set the stage for the day ahead.

There is a drawback to my walks and that's time. I am swapping a five-minute drive with a twenty-five-minute walk. Time is valuable, but this sacrifice is worth it.

My coworkers occasionally mention my walking. In the beginning, there was some light joking that I was trying to avoid them. After so many months, they realized I'm in it for the long haul and now comments are generally positive. Every once in awhile someone might say, "I should join you." But they almost never do. Two co-workers separately joined me one time and never returned. 

I know this is oddball behavior and not the only quirk. I am wearing a continuous glucose monitor despite not taking insulin or being on medication. For the last eleven months, I have written and published a post every single day, no exceptions. I am taking an online course on nutrition. I'm writing a book about sleep. 

Oddball.

I'm fine with that description. In the US, I look around at what is "average" and "normal," and I am absolutely thrilled to be an oddball. I know people may talk or say things to me or about me. That's fine because I'm not participating in a popularity contest.

> If you like me, that's your choice. If you respect me, that's my choice.
