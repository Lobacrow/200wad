I don't mean the iron associated with weightlifting. In fact, the kettlebell is the only piece of equipment I use that is actually made of iron. I am referring to iron in the blood.

Ferritin is a protein that stores iron and releases it when the body needs it. Ferritin proteins are usually found within cells with the biggest concentration in the liver.Â 

As with most biomarkers in the blood, there is a "normal" range for Ferritin. According to the lab results, the proper range for Ferritin is 30-400 ng/mL On my most recent lab test, my Ferritin was 719. By the way, a year ago it was over 1000.

Why is my Ferritin level so high? It turns out high Ferritin levels are associated with type 2 diabetes. Other common causes of high Ferritin are obesity, inflammation, and excessive alcohol intake. So, based on my history it's not a surprise that my Ferritin level is high.

I need to get my Ferritin levels within the normal range. So how does one reduce Ferritin? According to my doctor, the easiest way to lower iron levels in the blood is to donate blood. I scheduled a donation appointment tomorrow, and in a few months, I will have another lab test to see whether I need to make regular visits. It is a double benefit allowing me to dump off excess iron and provide universal donor blood to those in need.
