For over two years I have been working for a client in Baltimore, Maryland even though I live in Arizona. This week is my last week onsite. Here are some random thoughts about my experiences here.

The East Coast as a group are early risers. When the time difference is three hours, traveling back and forth and trying to stay on East Coast time while living in Arizona is brutal.

Maryland truly has the best crab cakes. I am spoiled now. In my opinion, the best ones are at G and M Restaurant.Â 

Speaking of more food, who knew the best fried chicken would be at a gas station of all places. Royal Farms fried chicken is spectacular.

The weather is very strange and random here. You never know what's going to be waiting for you when you step out in the morning and even how the weather will change throughout the day.

People love their sports teams here. The Orioles and the Ravens are very popular.

The proximity to Washington, D.C. seems to bring politics to the forefront more often.

I am grateful for the experience to meet new people and provide service to a great client. I am looking forward to the next adventure starting in 2019.
