_Phoenix, AZ_. Darren Jacobs was on a flight from Phoenix, AZ to San Jose, CA Sunday when he suddenly found himself in a conga line waiting for the airplane lavatory. Darren explained, "Well I was closer to the front lavatory and they tell you not to wait in the area by the cockpit door so I was waiting behind someone else. I looked behind me and two more people lined up." Other passengers on the flight reported heavy turbulence causing the line of people to sway with arms flailing in a make-shift conga line. Darren's wife Darla was also on the flight and commented, "I was watching Darren and the line of people while listening to Pitbull's "Fireball" when the turbulence hit, and it looked like they were dancing and I started laughing so hard."Â 

Due to the turbulence, the wait, and three cocktails, Darren confessed that he did not quite make it to the lavatory in time. He splashed water on the front of his jeans in an attempt to blame the lavatory faucet. Darren returned to his seat after the harrowing experience only to find his wife Darla laughing because she said she spilled water on the front of her pants. At press time, a witness who chose to remain anonymous reported that Darren and Darla were observed using Southwest in-flight WIFI to search Amazon for adult diapers.
