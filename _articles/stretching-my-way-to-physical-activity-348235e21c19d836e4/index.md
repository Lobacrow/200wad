On my journey to better health, I have focused on some key areas. I think sleep is so important that I'm writing a book about it. The working title of the book is _Start With Sleep_, so that's what I did. 

After sleep, the next area of focus is diet otherwise known as [Project Food as Fuel](https://200wordsaday.com/words/project-food-as-fuel-166515cd04215d04c0). I have been working on this aspect for about six months. I have seen some good improvements, but there is always room to improve in this area. Nevertheless, I feel like I'm ready to tackle the next area of focus--exercise.

I will freely admit I have been dragging my feet on this last one. I'm the guy who wakes up in cold sweats with nightmares of being back in PE class in high school. I'm non-athletic and whatever is the opposite of a jock. I once sprained my ankle playing a casual game of ping pong. 

I have more energy now, and I do want to exercise because of all the health benefits. Is there a downside to exercise? I can think of at least one. When you get older (say after turning 40), your body isn't the same as it used to be. On top of that, I'm starting with many years of neglect. If I start working out like crazy (especially when trying to add muscle), I know what's likely to happen--injury. Above all, I want to avoid injury. A few years ago I had a case of frozen shoulder (ironic since I live in the desert), and the physical rehab after that was not fun.

My strategy is to start out slow. So slow, in fact, that you might question whether what I'm doing should technically count as exercise. Hey, gotta start somewhere.

There is a new studio called [StretchLab](https://stretchlab.com/) that opened near my house. It turns out there are people called flexologists who are trained to provide customized, assistive stretching. 

Some of you may be thinking, "You mean you need to go someplace and pay money just to stretch? Just stay home and watch Yoga videos on YouTube!" Yes, I can certainly stretch on my own, but with a trained professional to help me the results will be much faster and far superior.

One of the techniques employed by the flexologist is called Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF). I just call it the ol' push and pull. The idea is that you stretch in one direction, and then you push in the opposite direction against pressure from the flexologist to allow for a deeper stretch. It actually works and would be difficult if not impossible to achieve by myself.

So what's so special about stretching? Among the many benefits are the following: 

*   improve sports performance
*   increase range of motion & flexibility
*   reduce muscle and joint pain
*   improve posture
*   improve relaxation and decrease stress

Today I had my first 50-minute session. I think I stretched some muscles that haven't been stretched since the Clinton Administration. I felt better right away and now a couple of hours later I feel fantastic!  I look forward to continuing my weekly sessions.

Looking forward to physical activity?? Did someone else take over this account? No, it's still Brandon working to be a better version of myself.

It's been a little over two months since I started with StretchLab. Last night I completed my tenth session. I've had three different flexologists, each with his or her own style.

I am happy to say that this activity is working. My flexibility has improved in a measurable way. Before I started stretching, I was unable to sit on my knees and come all the way back to touch my butt to my feet. Now I can do that. I was not able to bend all the way down and touch my toes. Now I can. My arms and shoulders have a better range of motion. I am slowly undoing the damage that sitting for long periods of time has done to me.

It's still work. If you imagine that I'm calmly lying down and getting stretched passively like a massage, think again. I don't work up a sweat, but I certainly work during the stretching with breathing exercises and resistance stretching. Sometimes it can be very uncomfortable or bordering on painful. 

Most of the time I walk out of there after a session feeling fantastic. Last night, however, I did some deep stretching that pushed me to my limit. I was already sore walking out of there, and I'm feeling it this morning. The last time I felt this sore was a time I went horseback riding. That's ok. Soreness is a sign of progress.

I will continue stretching for at least another month or two and then assess the frequency for a long term plan.
