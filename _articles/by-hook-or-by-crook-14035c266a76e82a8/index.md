I have no idea what’s going on today but the site was extremely slow for all my devices through my supposedly fast 40 MB internet connection. The only way I could access the site to publish today was to use my phone with WiFi turned off. 

So this is not the post I was planning. Nevertheless, I intend to keep the streak alive even it means occasionally typing a post with one or two fingers. There are worse fates for writers. Losing all fingers comes to mind. 

I guess we take for granted when everything just works. The moment things fail it’s easy to get riled up after all that entitlement. But it’s good to pause and reflect on what I have and be grateful. 

I am grateful that this is my penultimate day of work for a client I have worked with for over 2 years. December 31st marks the end on an era and then it’s on to the next adventure. Did someone say sunny California? Sure, I think I can make that work. 

I  also looking forward to more free time in the transition. It will be a good time to plan out the big goals for 2019. Not resolutions. Just big picture to stay focused.
