I suppose today's post should be inconsequential and nothing of substance since everyone is busy scrutinizing the just-released Mueller report. 

When there is a media frenzy about a particular story, it reminds me of my idea for creating a news site that I would call the Non-News News. The rule for this site would be if a story appears on any of the major news sites, it would NOT appear on the Non-News News site. There is supposed to be diversity in our news media, but when you go to different news sites and see the same topics and same stories I beg to differ. So, if you want those stories stick with your traditional news sites. Otherwise, maybe you would enjoy reading the Non-News News.

In other news (pun intended), I can't stand when there is a local news promo telling me there is valuable information but I have to wait to hear it. "New at 10--This grocery store item is part of a massive E. coli recall. Do you have it in your refrigerator?" Well I don't know because you didn't tell me what it is! If it's that important and you care about my wellbeing, tell me now and don't make me wait! Actually, if I do happen to hear one of those ads I just go online and find out in two seconds.

A year ago I felt that way about the news, and today I am doubling down on my attitude toward the news, which I refer to as "noise." The coronavirus pandemic is the latest example of how incredibly difficult it is to get accurate information without opinions or editorials. 

Even "celebrity" doctors like Dr. Drew, Dr. Phil, and Dr. Oz are coming under fire for controversial statements about the severity of the pandemic. I don't follow Dr. Drew, but I have looked into content from Dr. Phil and Dr. Oz. As with any source, you have to consider the agenda and evaluate whether the information is right for you. My chief problem with Dr. Phil is that he has had type 2 diabetes for many years, and I'm still waiting for him to announce that he's reversed it. Either he doesn't believe it's possible to reverse it, or he's just not willing to do what it takes to reverse it. Either way, I'm certainly not going to take his advice about diet or maintaining physical health. Dr. Oz has his own quackery, and I'd much rather follow content from a doctor like Peter Attia whom I trust gives sound information and advice.

By the way, if I had the Non-News News site up and running it would have ZERO stories about the coronavirus.
