On Facebook, I finally gave in to the new "challenge" that is circulating in which one is supposed to post his or her senior year picture from high school. 

I'm still trying to figure out the purpose of this challenge. Ostensibly it is to show support or solidarity for this year's high school seniors who will not have traditional graduation ceremonies and all the other associated activities. So, somehow showing support is flaunting the fact that all the other previous generations did get to have senior pictures? 

It is fun to compare what people look like now to the "prime of life." I can pretty much guarantee that anyone who looks at my senior picture would not recognize me at all. First of all, back then I had hair like Elvis. That's been long gone since college. Second, I was wearing glasses, which I no longer wear thanks to LASIK eye surgery.

I was grossly overweight and unhealthy for many years. I don't like looking at pictures of myself over the last 10-15 years. But I don't mind going all the way back to high school and remembering the "good ol' days." I'm trying to figure out how it's possible that some of my high school friends look almost exactly the same as 25 years ago.
