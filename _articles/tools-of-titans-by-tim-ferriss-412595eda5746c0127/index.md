If you don't know who Tim Ferriss is you're doing it wrong. You can find out more about him on his [website](https://tim.blog/). 

Tim is perhaps most famous for his book _The 4-Hour Workweek_. Tim has a very popular podcast called _The Tim Ferriss Show_, and he just launched a new short-form podcast based on his book _Tools of Titans_, which was published in 2017. It appears that this new podcast is going to be a collection of excerpts from the audiobook of _Tools of Titans_, which was just released. 

After two introductory episodes, the third episode focuses on the chapter on Naval Ravikant. There was so much fantastic, rapid-fire info in this episode that I had to grab the physical copy of the book to reference it. Here are some of the highlights, but I highly suggest you listen to the [short episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/tools-titans-tactics-routines-habits-world-class-performers/id1515607844#:~:text=Tools%20of%20Titans%20is%20a,the%20best%20in%20the%20world.). 

> If you want to be successful, surround yourself with people who are more successful than you are, but if you want to be happy, surround yourself with people who are less successful than you are.

The first rule of handling conflict is don't hang around people who are constantly engaging in conflict. 

Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.

Be present above all else.

Desire is suffering (Buddha).

If you can't see yourself working with someone for life, don't work with them for a day.

Reading (learning) is the ultimate meta-skill and can be traded for anything else.

All the real benefits in life come from compound interest.

Earn with your mind, not with your time.

99% of all effort is wasted.

Total honesty at all times. It's almost always possible to be honest and positive.

Praise specifically, criticize generally (Warren Buffett).

Truth is that which has predictive power.

What every thought. (Always ask, "Why am I having this thought?")

All greatness comes from suffering.

Love is given, not received.

What you choose to work on, and who you choose to work with, are far more important than how hard you work.

Free education is abundant, all over the internet. It's the desire to learn that's scarce.

If you eat, invest, and think according to what the 'news' advocates, you'll end up nutritionally, financially, and morally bankrupt.

The guns aren't new. The violence isn't new. The connected cameras are new, and that changes everything.

You get paid for being right first, and to be first, you can't wait for consensus.

My one related learning in life: "There are no adults." Everyone's making it up as they go along. Figure it out yourself, and do it.

A busy mind accelerates the passage of subjective time.
