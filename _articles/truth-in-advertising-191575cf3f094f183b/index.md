I like playing video games. The iPad is a great device for games. Lately, I have been playing a game called Klondike. This is a game that is free-to-play but has in-app purchases. This type of game is also referred to as "freemium." The first big game of this type that took Facebook by storm years ago was Farmville. 

The idea is that you get hooked on the gameplay and end up spending money on whichever game currency allows you to do things faster or better. I do not fall for the tricks and play the long game without spending a penny. 

One of the other tricks these games use is providing opportunities for bonuses or speed-ups if you watch ads (usually for other games). I play along with this trick because half the time I'm watching TV or looking at another screen anyway. When I do watch the ads, I see one interesting similarity. The ads show you the best possible scenarios for whichever game is demonstrated. 

The example that comes to mine is a slot machine game. I used to play slot machine games years ago to satisfy a gambling itch without the consequence of losing money. It turns out, I saw an ad for the very slot machine game I used to play. This add showed jackpots and hundreds of free spins and basically every possible best-case scenario in a few short seconds. I played that slot machine game daily for months maybe even close to a year and never once experienced any of the scenes depicted in the ad.

The same goes for tv or print ads. You watch a commercial for some product and you hear testimonials from people talking about how amazing the product is. If you notice the fine print at the bottom, it reads "Results not typical." Why don't they show you the typical results? Well, that wouldn't get you to buy the product now would it?

Have you seen the articles comparing the ads for fast food to the reality of what you get when you order? I used to hear the term "false advertising" a lot, but now I don't hear about it much. Maybe it's because we all realize that sadly there isn't much truth in advertising. 

When I choose to offer my own products eventually, I will keep this in mind. Yes, the advertising needs to be compelling and tell a story. But I want there to be truth. The result may be to appeal to a smaller audience but hopefully a more satisfied one.
