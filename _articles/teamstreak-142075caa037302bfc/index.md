You knew this was coming. It's time to decide which team you're on. 

On 200WAD there are all kinds of writers and a myriad of reasons why people are writing. There are the "one and done" crowd sometimes highlighted by @OnePostersGems. There are people dabbling who may not have decided whether they are writers or want to become writers. There are people who already have their own blogs who cross-publish on 200WAD. 

I want to speak for the team to which I belong unapologetically.

My team is about consistency. 

My team is about showing up every day. 

My team is about no excuses. 

My team is about publishing every day no matter what happens.

Your internet went out. So what, figure it out like @efran. You're sick? Poor baby, write anyway. You have writer's block and cannot write 200 words? Suck it up. You waited until 11:45 PM to write and something happened and you failed to publish. Wrong answer. "Well I don't want to publish a post just for the sake of keeping a streak going." There's probably another team for you, but it's definitely not my team. If you want to be on my team, you won't let anything get in the way of showing up every day. By the way, if you are a patron and schedule your posts then fine by me. 

A...B....C...Always Be Closing from the movie _Glengarry GlenRoss_. I would like to suggest a minor change for my team. Always Be CREATING.

My team is not for everyone. In fact, I would say my team is for a minority of people who are truly dedicated to improving their writing skills one day at a time.  

Anyone can write for a day, couple days, ten days, fifteen days. I want to see at least 30 days. If you publish every day for 30 days, I will personally welcome you to my team. If you break your streak at any point, thanks for playing but there will be no consolation prizes. Feel free to start all over again, and I'll leave the light on for you when you reach another 30 consecutive days. 

Let me now spotlight the people who are already on my team (whether they wanted to be or not):
