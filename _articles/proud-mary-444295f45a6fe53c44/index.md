_You know, every now and then_

_I think you might like to hear something from us_

_Nice and easy but there's just one thing_

_You see, we never ever do nothing nice and easy_

_We always do it nice and rough_

_So we're going to take the beginning of this song_

_And do it easy_

_Then we're going to do the finish rough_

_This is the way we do 'Proud Mary'_

_And we're rolling, rolling, rolling on the river_

_Listen to the story now..._

So begins the song _Proud Mary_ by Ike and Tina Turner. The original _Proud Mary_ was written by John Fogerty and released by Creedence Clearwater Revival in 1969. While the original recording is great, this may be one of the few cases where a cover version exceeds the original in my humble opinion.

There is something about the rawness of Tina Turner's vocals, and the shift from the slow and easy pace to doing it "rough" when all hell breaks loose. 

Before there was Whitney or Madonna or Beyonce or Adele or Ga Ga or something called Cardi B (Ugh doesn't belong in the same sentence and is a non-name if there ever was one), there was Tina. 

If you have never heard this song, now is a good time to give it a spin. Here is a great [live version](https://youtu.be/hzQnPz6TpGc).
