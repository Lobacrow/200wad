Outside of holidays or vacation, if it's a weekday I am working, Which is why today is unusual in that I am not working for a client. I am a consultant in the health insurance IT space, and my company uses a concept known as "the bench." What is great about the bench is that I still get paid my salary even if I am not currently assigned to a client.

I am waiting for the paperwork to go through for the next assignment, which could start as early as next Monday or might be a week after that. So, for this week my days are wide open.Â 

Thankfully this time happens to coincide with the new year and a new emphasis for me on goal-setting and planning. So I won't be wasting all this time goofing off in front of the TV. I will be structuring my time to help establish daily habits and start taking action. I want to make the best use of this time before work kicks back in and dictates the majority of my time during the week.

I am grateful for the opportunity of the precious resource of time. I will not let myself down.
