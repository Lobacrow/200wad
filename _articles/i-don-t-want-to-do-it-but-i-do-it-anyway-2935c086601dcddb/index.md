Why is it so hard to commit to goals or activities that you truly want to accomplish? Maybe deep down it's something you really do not want? Perhaps, but I think there is a better answer.

I am using something called The Freedom Journal by John Lee Dumas to achieve a goal of weight loss and becoming physically healthier. Yes, I absolutely want to lose weight and improve my health. That involves mindful eating and physical activity. I absolutely want to achieve this goal, so why is it so hard to do the things I need to do every day to achieve the goal?Â 

I think it's hard because I give myself a way out. Okay, I didn't do a bike ride today so I'll make up for it tomorrow. Or I let feelings override my mental commitment. Well I just don't feel like getting my steps in today after sitting at a computer all day. You know, I went all day without eating anything so I'm going to have "good" dinner. The short term pay-off wins over the long-term goal.

So what's the fix? The fix is to mentally commit to your goal and the actions to achieve it. Write it down. Re-state your goal every day. And train your body so that when your mind says go the body goes.

I recently attended a one-day training event that featured Tony Robbins. Among the many examples he used, one is pertinent to this topic. At all of his houses he has a custom-made "dunk tank" for lack of a better word. He keeps this tank at 56 degrees, and he takes a full-body plunge into it every morning. He doesn't want to do it. The last thing you want to do first thing in the morning is plunge into cold water. But he has made this commitment and he does it every day.

Once you have a vision for your future and you know the specific goals you want to achieve, commit to yourself to make it happen. Forget about who is watching. Hold yourself accountable. You are in charge and in control. Find a system that works for you whether it's writing every day, setting reminders/alarms on your phone, or establishing solid morning/bedtime routines.

This is not easy. It's taken awhile just for me to get where I am with a long ways to go. But it's worth it.
