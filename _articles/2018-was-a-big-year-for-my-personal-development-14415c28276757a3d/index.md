> Learn to work harder on yourself than you do on your job. If you work hard on your job you'll make a living, if you work hard on yourself you can make a fortune.--Jim Rohn

Prior to 2018, I was just dabbling in personal development. I read some books, listened to some podcasts, but I really didn't take it that seriously. This year I decided to make a change.

I attended seven personal/professional training events in 2018. Some were part of a day or a full day, others were multiple days. By the way, the first one was in June, so I accomplished this all in the second half of the year.

These training events not only helped with knowledge and new ideas but also helped me with the motivation to take action. This is perhaps the most important aspect.

I have decided to take charge and ownership of my health. I have made sleep a top priority. My mind seems to have been refreshed with a new sense of wonder with learning. I have more energy, and I am carrying this momentum into the near year.

Without question, the best thing I decided to do in 2018 was to focus on my own development. Looking forward to the next year and the future has never been brighter.
