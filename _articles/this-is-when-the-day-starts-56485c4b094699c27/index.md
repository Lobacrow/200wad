I was listening to episode #560 of Bulletproof Radio, the podcast hosted by Dave Asprey. His guest was Satchin Panda, PhD, a leading expert in Circadian biology. Satchin said something very interesting:

> The day doesn't start when you wake up in the morning. The day starts when you go to bed the night before.

Much has been written about the importance of how you start your day. I agree, the way you start your day is very important. But what sets the tone for how you start your day is how you slept the previous night.  

So many people reach the end of the day and regret how bad the day went. They are disappointed with how much they did or did not accomplish. They go to sleep the same way they do every night thinking tomorrow will be better. The problem is if these people are not getting good sleep, they are already starting behind the eight ball.

I encourage you to re-frame your perspective. Tomorrow starts when you go to sleep tonight. Are you going to set yourself up for success and wellbeing? 

If you are interested in Circadian rhythms or biohacking for sleep, I would encourage you to listen to the full podcast episode. You can find the Bulletproof radio podcast wherever you listen to podcasts.
