I've read stories about people who have been in terrible accidents and had to learn to walk again. I can't imagine that. Walking is something so automatic to me that I cannot imagine not knowing how to do it and learning it all over again.

Only recently have I realized that I never truly learned how to eat. Sure, I know how to identify edible items and shovel them in, but I never learned nutrition or that eating is about consuming fuel and building blocks for the body.Â 

I am about to embark on a new journey to learn how to eat. I am doing this for health reasons. I have become carb-intolerant and insulin-resistant. Type 2 diabetes is no joke.
