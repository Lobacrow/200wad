The problem with a traditional belt is that it does not allow for fine tuning. Have you ever been "between holes" in which one hole is too loose and the next hole is too tight? What about running out of holes and having to bore another one? 

In high school the big trend was woven belts without any holes. You simply pushed the metal stem through the belt where it was comfortable. The problem is that over time, the weave started to separate and fray because the metal stem was always in the same place.

The other problem I've had with a belt is how to wear it in conjunction with a belly. There is a phenomenon I refer to as "bifurcated belly" which occurs when a rotund person wears a belt around the belly and then sits down.  This can also lead to a bizarre twisting of the belt where it physically exists in multiple planes simultaneously.

I have determined that we have reached peak innovation in the sartorial subspace of belts. Call off the inventors because they've finally figured it out. For years I have been using ratchet-style belts. There are several brands, notably the Mission Belts and Slide Belts. These belts use a ratchet system in which there are notches on the inside of the belt and the buckle settles into the notch you want. These notches give fine control allowing one to get a perfect fit every time. The belt locks in place but can be easily released by pulling the buckle.

I will say there is one small negative of using this type of belt. In the men's room when I'm buckling my pants, there is the distinct click click click of the belt as it slides in place. This sound is magnified by the pronounced echo in the bathroom, my imagination, or both. I try to time it with the urinal flush or if all else fails a well-timed cough can mask the potentially embarrassing sound. It's a small price to pay for an otherwise well-designed belt.
