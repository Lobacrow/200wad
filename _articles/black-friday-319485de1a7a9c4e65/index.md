I never bought into the idea of signing up with the stampede of people outside Walmart or Target or any other store trying to get some sort of huge bargain. Nowadays, it's online or bust. But it's still buyer beware.

Amazon is trying to convince me that 5% off is a Black Friday discount. No thanks. In fact, I don't even get out of bed for 10% off today. It takes a MINIMUM of 20% to even get my attention, and usually at least 30% to get my trigger finger warmed up. 

It was mostly a bust today, but that's fine because I haven't been looking for much. Thankfully, @jasonleow pointed out the Perfect Keto 50% off sale and that was a good find. Sir @abrahamkim might raise his eyebrows when he discovers I got a deal on a Yeti Blue USB microphone for some future audio content. 

Can someone answer how a 70" Samsung flat-screen TV is somehow less than $500?? TVs are certainly one class of electronics that have had a steady decline in prices over the years. My theory is that all the crap installed on "smart" TV's is somehow tracking you, so you are paying for it with your privacy.
