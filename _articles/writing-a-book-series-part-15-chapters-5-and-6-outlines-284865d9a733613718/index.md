**Chapter 5: Morning Routine**

Hook: All the crazy ways people use to wake up in the morning. Examples: Alarm clock across the room, multiple alarms, the dreaded snooze button, the alarm clock oven that makes bacon.

Thesis: Your morning routine sets the stage for the day and for that night's sleep. Make it count.

Supporting content: Say hello to the sun. Consider mental preparation either planning or meditation. 

Story: My experience with a morning meditation. Waking up without an alarm clock. 

Reader's key takeaway: If you do something every day, optimize it. 1-2 hours after waking up is a golden time that should not be wasted.

Segue: What if you're just NOT a morning person?

**Chapter 6: Circadian Timing**

Hook: On babies, kids, young adults, and elderly. 

Thesis: Discover your chronotype, and use your body's natural timing cycle to maximize your sleep.

Supporting content: Chronotype quiz and summary of the four main chronotypes: Dolphin, Lion, Bear, Wolf

Story: My personal chronotype and how I have used it to plan my daily schedule and sleep schedule.

Reader's key takeaway: Figure out your natural timing and use it to work with your body and not against it.

Segue: One of the key drivers of our daily cycle is light. Light is a very important variable that has a major effect on sleep.
