Yesterday I ventured out into the heat to see Quentin Tarantino's new movie _Once Upon a Time in Hollywood_. I rarely see movies on the opening weekend to avoid crowds, and I rarely deem a movie worthy of being seen in a theater (again crowds). 

I do like most Tarantino movies. His last one _The Hateful Eight_ was a dud for me. But one of his movies is on my favorite movies list and will be the subject of a future post. Sadly, the new movie did not make the list.

The movie seems to have a lot going for it. The two main characters are portrayed by A-List actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. In fact, my friend who saw the movie with me said those two actors saved the movie. The movie is set in 1969 in Hollywood, and you do get immersed in the time period through all the visual and musical references.  In short, I would say it's a lot of style but not a lot of substance in the form of plot. 

Tarantino has said that he will stop making movies after his 10th picture. The current movie is technically his 10th movie if you count Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2 as two movies but he counts them as one movie. Maybe Tarantino realizes he doesn't have much left in the tank. If you are a Tarantino fan, then I think there is just enough in this movie to entertain you. But don't get your hopes up.
