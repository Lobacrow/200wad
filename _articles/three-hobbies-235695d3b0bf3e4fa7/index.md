Sometimes a simple picture quote can be a powerful trigger to change your thinking or your behavior. Here is one I saw recently.

Find three hobbies you love:

**One to make you money**,

**One to keep you in shape**,

**One to be creative**.

First, I like the use of the word _hobby_. A hobby implies an activity that you do because you enjoy it not because you have to do it. Other words like _job_, _vocation_, and _career_, have different connotations and not all of them are positive.

A hobby starts with joy and interest and satisfaction. If you are clever about choosing a hobby, you can meet the criteria listed above. If you find a hobby that hits all three then you've got the trifecta. 

So now the hard part is to figure out whether I have my hobbies. 

**One to make you money** - I don't have this one yet, but I'm working on it. I need to work harder.

**One to keep you in shape** - There are two parts to this for me: diet and exercise. I've been working on diet as part of Project Food as Fuel. I don't know that I would classify the keto diet as a hobby (more like a lifestyle). The exercise one is a bit more elusive, but so far I would say bike riding is the closest thing I have right now.

**One to be creative** - Well this one is the easiest one. Without a doubt my hobby of writing every day is my creative outlet.
