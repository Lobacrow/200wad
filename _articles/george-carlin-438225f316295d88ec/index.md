George Carlin is one of my all-time favorite comedians. I know he's not everyone's cup of tea, especially if you're not a fan of foul language. He didn't just use obscenities willy nilly. He had a purpose using these words and pointing out hypocrisy. He was an expert on human behavior and certainly a master of words and the English language. Many of my favorite bits of his revolve around pointing out the absurdity of the language we use. 

"Get on the plane." "!#%!# you, I'm getting IN the plane. Evil Knievel can get ON the plane." 

"Those two planes had a near miss." "No, it was a near hit!" 

I saw George Carlin live only once back in 2007. You could tell he was slowing down, but he still demonstrated his classic wit and keen observations. George passed away in June of 2008 at the age of 71. 

I know he was a widow at least once, but I was unable to track down whether his last wife also died before he did. He certainly suffered loss, and at some point toward the end of his life, he wrote a very poignant letter that I wanted to share with everyone. This letter was written at least twelve years ago, but I think every bit of it is still valid today. 

  

The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings but shorter tempers, wider Freeways, but narrower viewpoints. We spend more, but have less, we buy more, but enjoy less. We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less time. We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness.  
  
We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom.  
  
We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often.  
We've learned how to make a living, but not a life. We've added years to life not life to years. We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor. We conquered outer space but not inner space. We've done larger things, but not better things.  
  
We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice. We write more, but learn less. We plan more, but accomplish less. We've learned to rush, but not to wait. We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less.  
  
These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small character, steep profits and shallow relationships.  
  
These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes. These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill. It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom. A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete.  
  
Remember to spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not going to be around forever.  
  
Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side.  
  
Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a cent.  
  
Remember, to say, 'I love you' to your partner and your loved ones, but most of all mean it. A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of you.  
  
Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person will not be there again.  
  
Give time to love, give time to speak! And give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind.  
  
And always remember, life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by those moments that take our breath away.  
  
George Carlin
