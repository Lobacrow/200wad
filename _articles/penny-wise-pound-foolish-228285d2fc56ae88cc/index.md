I just filled up the ol' car with gas. I don't pay attention to the price of gas anymore. The last time I actually paid attention to the price of gas was a few months ago in California when the price per gallon was approaching $5. Even then I just chuckled while sitting in the Uber.  

When the original iPhone was released in 2010, one of the "web-apps" that I used a lot was a gas price finder. I used it to find the cheapest gas, and I would drive out of my way just to make sure I got the cheapest price. Yes, I had the most expensive cell phone in the market and was driving around trying to save a penny or two per gallon on gas. Not anymore.

I have come to understand that time is more valuable than money. Sure, I don't want to waste money or pay more than I should for something. But now I draw the line.  

The British saying, "Penny wise, pound foolish" is a good one. I take it to mean someone who wastes time saving a penny and missing the bigger picture. Eliminating satellite TV and saving over $100 per month--that's big picture. Worrying about $0.99/month for iCloud space, not big picture.

Some people might argue, "Yes, but those pennies add up." I call it the price of doing business. I'm not going to waste time focusing on the pennies
