Click stopwatch.

Some people have timed themselves to see how fast they can churn out a post. I am crunched for time and won't be back home until late this evening. Now is as good a time as any to join in the fun. I find that I'm actually making more typing mistakes than normal. Maybe I should slow down to speed up?

Of course, since this is a post all about speed, it will likely not have much substance. I guess this would be considered a sprint in runner's parlance. I suppose it is also some form of proof that writing consistently has sharpened the chops to a point where churning out something coherent in a short amount of time is indeed possible.

It's the last day of August. Too bad I didn't have a nice summary of goals and achievements and all that. I can work on that in September, when I will achieve the anniversary of the date of my birth. I can't believe it's almost here already. I wonder what the celebration dinner will be and how compliant it will be with Project Food As Fuel. We shall see.

Click. Stop. 3 minutes 11 seconds.
