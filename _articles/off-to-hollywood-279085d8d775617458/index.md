After returning home from San Jose, CA yesterday, I'm doing what those in the industry call a "turn and burn" by flying to Burbank, CA to wrap up my Summer Concert Series. This summer I saw [Sir Paul McCartney](https://200wordsaday.com/words/sir-paul-mccartney-212445d14d27e7ad42) and the [Rolling Stones](https://200wordsaday.com/words/the-rolling-stones-259455d653be6d5cad). I'm rounding out the series with one more bloke (well, two blokes) from the UK. Tonight, for one night only, Rod Stewart is reuniting with his former bandmate and legendary guitarist Jeff Beck. 

Rod Stewart is known as a solo artist, but prior to becoming a solo act, he was the lead singer of several bands, notably The Faces and The Jeff Beck Group. It is the latter in which Beck's virtuoso guitar playing was paired with Rod's raw vocals to produce some great material. One of my favorite songs of this era is a cover song [I Ain't Superstitious](https://youtu.be/JqpclYuZabs). 

Considering the rather contention relationship between these two legends, some said a reunion would never be possible. Rock star egos and all that. But the ice has thawed enough for one night, and I did not want to miss it. The concert is at the Hollywood Bowl, which is a brand new venue for me. 

My review will be forthcoming.
