I've been working six days a week for months now, and I don't know what it feels like to have an extended break. 

The first day of vacation doesn't feel like vacation. I'm still at home and won't be traveling to Sedona, AZ until later today.

I think I am feeling one of the consequences of working at home. My daily routine has become so intertwined with work that it is difficult to physically and mentally unplug. 

This will be a good time to pause and reflect on how things are going on a daily basis. I used to take inventory each month and plan at a higher level, but I've decided that was not working for me. It's what you do daily that matters.

Of all my habits, writing is the only one I've consistently maintained every day despite all the obstacles thrown my way. This is one habit I will not give up, even if it means I need to start using a different tool to express myself. 

What does a workhorse do when it has a break from work? I guess it's time to find out.

The birthday weekend begins.
