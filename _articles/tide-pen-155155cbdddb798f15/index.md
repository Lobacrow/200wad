This morning at the hotel I was having a nice cup of coffee. Unfortunately, I realized too late that the plastic lid was not quite a match for the cup leading to a spill on my shirt. The last thing I wanted to do was walk around the office all day with a highly-visible coffee stain. Tide pen to the rescue!

The Tide pen (officially called Tide to Go) is a great invention. It's about the size of a dry erase marker and easily fits in my bag. The Tide pen is an instant stain remover. It is most effective when you apply it as soon as you discover the stain before it sets. The tip is designed to push in to release the liquid. I used the pen as soon as I discovered the stain, and by the time I got to the office the stain was gone!

I think the makers of the Tide pen should join forces with the makers of the EpiPen. The EpiPen is an injection device that contains epinephrine, a chemical designed to reverse the effects of severe allergic reactions. If someone is having a sudden and severe allergic reaction, chances are he or she is also going to spill something and create a stain. I envision a new device that is both EpiPen and Tide pen together. Whoever is assisting the person can give the Epi injection, then flip the pen over and apply the Tide pen to any ensuing stains.
