Writing can feel like a lonely gig. It's you and the blank page. Maybe even a voice in your head that's either your muse or your critic. It takes courage to not only write your thoughts but publish them for others to see.

I'm glad you're here.

There are many other things you could be doing with your time. There are many other places on the internet that are more titillating (pun intended) or engaging. But you chose to spend time in our little writing corner.

I'm glad you're here.

Maybe you don't see notifications very often. Maybe your posts don't get comments. Is anyone even reading what you're writing? We've all had those thoughts, and some people burn out without the acknowledgment or praise or even just being noticed. But you haven't burned out. You keep coming back.

I'm glad you're here.

As 2020 continues along, the world seems to get crazier and crazier. The pandemic continues to rage on. History-making fires in California. Two storms in the Gulf of Mexico. That's just my neck of the woods! There are plenty of reasons to shut it all down. To stop reading. To stop creating. That may be for others, but that's not for you. You know why you're here, even if no one else does. I may not know all your specific reasons for writing, but I understand why you're here.Â 

And I'm glad you're here.
