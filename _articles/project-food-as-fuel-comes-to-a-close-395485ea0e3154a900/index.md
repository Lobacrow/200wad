I started [Project Food as Fuel](https://cowriters.app/words/project-food-as-fuel-166515cd04215d04c0) almost one year ago. My goal, stated simply, was to reverse type 2 diabetes. I accomplished my goal. 

So what's next?

I am fulfilling my one-year commitment with Virta Health Clinic, and I will not be staying on for another year. Virta was a great experience and certainly helped me accomplish my goal. But Virta has a narrow focus--to reverse type 2 diabetes. Now that I've done that, I need the next level of focus for my health.

The physician assistant I used to see at my PCP's office is no longer with the practice. I figured as long as I have to start all over again with someone new, I might as well explore my options. I was also pushed over the edge by the office offering telehealth visits at $30 per 5-minute increments paid upfront, and then I have to haggle with the insurance company. No thank you.

I like the idea of telemedicine and not having to wait in line at a doctor's office to see the doctor in person. Sure there might be issues or maladies that require an in-person visit, but the vast majority of visits can be done remotely. This is also convenient since I have traveled a lot in the past. Who knows what the future travel schedule looks like.

I found a telemedicine service called [SteadyMD](https://www.steadymd.com/) from an ad on Facebook. The premise is that I pay a monthly membership fee to have access to a primary care doctor anytime. There are no copays and my health insurance can be used when needed. 

I signed up and had my first virtual visit today. It lasted about 1.5 hours. This is the longest doctor visit I've ever had. He was very thorough and interested in the totality of my life and experience. 

At one point I mentioned one of the prescription medicines I was taking when I was first diagnosed with diabetes. He said he did not recognize the medicine. I was surprised by that. Then he said he's usually focused on getting people off medication not adding more on. Bingo! I found the right doctor.

Next up I will be doing some lab work and working with him to develop a plan. In June I am scheduled to get a DEXA body fat composition scan, which he says is a more accurate picture compared to a number on a scale. 

I'm not making any major changes to my diet, so I will remain pretty much keto without being in ketosis 100% of the time. I am sure we will refine my diet to make it a little more sustainable long term. 

The next chapter begins.
