"Did you hear about AirPods 5 coming out next year?"

"No, and have there been that many iterations??"

"Two big things. 10-hr battery life and real-time language translation." 

"How's that going to work?"

"When you turn it on, Siri listens to the person who's talking and translates it on the fly."

"Yah, but won't that be confusing hearing the other person and Siri?"

"It will tune out the speaker so you can hear just the translation. If the other person has AirPods, they'll get a translation of what you say too. Cool, huh? And the new AirPods are coming the same time as Apple glasses. You can set it so that when Siri hears you or someone else, it will display related info in Apple glasses."

"Ok glasses sound cool, but Google already has translation. Remember when we were in Pasadena, and I aimed my camera at the signs in Chinese and Korean and it translated them instantly?"

"Oh yeah, that's been around for a while. Did you turn the auto-translation on in your browser? Where it will automatically translate any webpage to English or any language?"

"I thought you had to copy/paste into Google Translate..."

"No man, get with the times. The future is already here. Remember that chatbot you thought was a person? hehe"

"Dude, I don't care what you say. That WAS a real person." 

"Not it wasn't. But it's gotten so good you can't tell the difference. If you asked for a manager you would have gotten a real person. But Amazon uses a chatbot on the frontline customer service."

"Next you'll be telling me that girl who friended me on Facebook isn't real."

"She probably isn't."

"Jealous much?? She's been messaging me and has Instagram posts AND she sent me a link to her blog. She even sent me a video where she mentioned my name and stuff we talked about."

"Haven't you heard of deep fakes? Any amateur can do that now are you kidding?? Until you meet her in person, assume it's just AI messing with you. You're getting your rocks off with nothing but code! hahahaha"

"I'm doing no such thing! So basically, you're saying I could be reading AI blog posts from other languages and having chats and messages and videos with AI bots and none of it is from a real person??"

"Welcome to 21st-century communication!"
