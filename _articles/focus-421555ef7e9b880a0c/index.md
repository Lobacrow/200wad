It's amazing how much you can accomplish when you eliminate distractions and focus on a singular task. And I'm not talking about some Pomodoro 20 minutes. 

I put in a solid six hours this morning working on a project for my second client. I was on the phone with a co-worker the entire time, and it made a world of difference. This is a part-time gig for me, and my work on the project has been scattered. There's rarely time for us to work together in real-time on the same items. We are planning to have another working session tomorrow morning.

The reason for this frenzied work is a looming deadline. We have a pretty big documentation deliverable that is due by the end of June, and then I'm going to be out of the office starting July 1st. 

My coworker has remarked that he is amazed at how quickly I'm able to wordsmith and edit documents on the fly (the term he uses is "Brandonize"). This is one of the many benefits of consistent writing. #Teamstreak

Maybe there is something to this idea of [Essentialism](https://cowriters.app/words/essentialism-421155ef6a2609c001) and focusing on the most important thing. I'm excited about employing a similar strategy for the main gig and see how that improves my performance and job satisfaction.
