I had a conversation with a buddy of mine the other day. We are both trying to break out of the Matrix. He has put a lot of time, energy, and money into learning about real estate. He confessed that lately, any time he thinks about the next step of what to do in real estate he gets anxiety and an overall uncomfortable feeling. He wondered, "Is that just the feeling of being out of my comfort zone and should I just push through that? Or is it a red flag that maybe this isn't the right path for me?" I know real estate is a popular choice for many people pursuing side hustles. It is not my choice. It just doesn't do it for me. I wish it did. 

I have been a consultant for five years in the health insurance IT industry. Few people I know either in or out of the industry actually like health insurance. This role requires a lot of travel, which keeps me away from home and steals my time. They don't send us to companies that are running smoothly, so work tends to be chaotic and stressful. Yes, I get paid well, but in some ways, this is a trap. If I were getting paid less, I'd have more of a fire lit under me to change my situation. It's very comfortable staying in that comfort zone. Nevertheless, I'm trying to start my own fire. Staying in hotels 137 nights in a year will do that to you.

My rule for any side hustle is that I better be passionate about what I'm doing. I already have a job that is unfulfilling that I'm not passionate about. I don't need another one. I am going to enjoy the process, or I'm not going to pursue it. 

There is a difference between the uncomfortable feeling of trying something new and the feeling that something is just not right for you. The key is knowing the difference. You don't want to miss out on opportunities that are one step away. You also don't want to go too far down a path with sunken costs keeping you involved long after you should have pulled up anchor and sailed on.
