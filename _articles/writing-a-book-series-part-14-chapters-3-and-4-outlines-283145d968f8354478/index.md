**Chapter 3: Evening Routine**

Hook: Flying analogy. When getting ready to land, seatbacks fully upright and tray tables up and in locked position to prepare for landing. 

Satchin Panda quote - The day doesn't start when you wake up in the morning. The day starts the night before when you go to sleep.

Thesis: Having a consistent evening routine is one of the most powerful ways to ensure a good night's sleep.

Supporting content:

*   Eating/drinking close to bedtime
*   Physical activity near bedtime
*   Mental activity near bedtime (quieting the mind)
*   Devices

Story: How I established my evening routine. "Come on Chewy, you don't want treats! You'll get used to it!"

Reader's key takeaway: Establishing an evening routine that you can consistently follow will greatly improve your chances of good sleep.

Segue: What happens when you finally drift off to dreamland? 

**Chapter 4: Sleep Stages 101**

Hook: Why is it sometimes you wake up even before your alarm wide away and ready to go and other times you can't stop hitting the snooze button?

Thesis: The brain is anything but inactive as we sleep. There are different stages of sleep and each one is important and related to certain aspects of mental and physical functions.

Supporting content:

*   Light sleep
*   Deep sleep
*   REM sleep

Story: Priding myself on falling asleep as soon as my head hits the pillow but turns out that it is a sign of sleep deprivation. Power naps--good or bad?

Reader's key takeaway: Understanding the importance of each phase of sleep. How depriving sleep in each phase affects health.

Segue: You've had a blissful night of restful sleep. It's time to wake up, and what you do that morning will affect the _next_ night's sleep.
