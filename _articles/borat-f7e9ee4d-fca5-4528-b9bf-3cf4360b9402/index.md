Today is the day when the new Borat movie is released on Amazon Prime. The official title is _Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan_

I remember watching the first Borat film and having some major belly laughs, so I'm looking forward to this one. I know this content is not everyone's cup of tea. Some people find the characterizations and jokes to be offensive. I don't get offended easily, but the true determinant for me is whether it's funny. There are jokes that are deliberately offensive and in poor taste but not funny. I don't like content that is offensive for the sake of it. In the end, it's gotta be funny. Of course comedy, much like beauty, is in the eye of the consumer.

Sacha Baron Cohen, who portrays Borat, has another character called Bruno who conducted an [interview with a pastor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LazrAzBP_0I) that is one of my favorite ones of all time.

I'm due for some hard laughter. Not small chuckles, but full-blown guffaws that cause me to press pause, and start coughing/choking/crying. Let's hope this movie delivers that experience.
