I don't have kids, but based on my observations of other people who have kids there seems to be a pattern. For those of you who have kids, please add more to the list.

Adults love things that kids do not.

1.  Going to bed. When you tell kids it's bedtime, most will immediately fight you to stay up later and prolong the inevitable. Tell an adult it's time to go to sleep, and most adults love the idea.
2.  Eating dinner. Kids don't seem to relish meals the way adults do. Kids eat like they are at Chuck E Cheese, and the next great adventure awaits just after they finish a slice of pizza and take a swig of pop. When it's time to eat, I would say most adults enjoy sitting down for a nice meal and prolonging the experience.
3.  Taking a bath/shower. Kids are not known for good hygiene in general. If you leave it up to them, I'm sure they'd be fine going days without bathing. Tell an adult that he or she can go take a hot bath and most will skip-to-my-loo to get to the bathroom.

Any other activities that would make the list?
