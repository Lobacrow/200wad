It was so great to read @basilsamel 's summary of the [first 6 months of 200WAD](https://200wordsaday.com/words/200wad-is-6-months-old-181235ce50c0f06bfa). In six months, the number of posts and the number of words are truly amazing, but what is even more amazing to me is the **community**. 

People are writing on 200WAD for all sorts of reasons. Each reason is important to each person, but as a collective the important thing is people are writing.

Thoughts are real. When those thoughts are captured in words. That's power. And when those words are shared with other people? Even more power. And when those people come together and interact and expand each other's ideas and create new ideas--whoa. Massive power. The power to change minds. The power to change emotions. The power to change our lives and make us better human beings.

People have the power.

> No two minds ever come together without, thereby, creating a third, invisible, intangible force which may be likened to a third mind. --Napoleon Hill

@basilesamel your work does have an impact. You gave us the tool. It's up to us to make the most of it. One word at a time. 200 words (or more) at a time. Each day and every day for those of us committed to #Teamstreak.

> I was dreaming in my dreaming  
> Of an aspect bright and fair  
> And my sleeping it was broken  
> But my dream it lingered near  
> In the form of shining valleys  
> Where the pure air recognized  
> And my senses newly opened  
> I awakened to the cry  
> That the people have the power  
> To redeem the work of fools  
> Upon the meek the graces shower  
> It's decreed the people rule  
> The people have the power  
> The power to dream to rule  
> To wrestle the world from fools  
> It's decreed the people rule  
> I believe everything we dream  
> Can come to pass through our union  
> We can turn the world around  
> We can turn the earth's revolution  
> We have the power  
> People have the power  
> People have the power  
> People have the power  
> People have the power

_People Have the Power_ by Patti Smith  

My favorite version of this song is the [live version](https://youtu.be/wdosEFucxcY?t=76) performed by U2 and the Eagles of Death Metal in Paris shortly after the terrorist attack in 2015.

What's the point of writing here, keeping your streak alive? Sometimes writing a seemingly inconsequential post of nothing just to post. Rushing to type before that midnight deadline. They can't all be hits. That's ok. Keep going.

The act of writing has the power to change you. And it has the power to change all of us in the community.

People have the power. 

We have the power.
