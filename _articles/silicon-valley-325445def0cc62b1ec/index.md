I just watched the series finale of the HBO show _Silicon Valley_. This show has been one wild ride. For those who are unfamiliar, this show follows a group of misfit coders as they navigate the waters of being a start-up in the tech capital of the US. There are six seasons, but the last two seasons are short a few episodes.

One of the co-creators of the show is Mike Judge, whose name might be familiar to you if you know _Beavis and Butthead_ or the movie _Office Space_. 

I admit it takes another level of humor to get me to LOL and this show has it. There is a lot of vulgarity and crass "guy humor," but there are also sharp parodies of real-life tech crises and scandals. The cast works well together, and every episode has some sort of quirky humor that I find highly entertaining. 

This was one of the last shows that kept me on HBO after _Game of Thrones_ and now it's over. I guess it's time to pull the plug on HBO, but darn it if that new show starring Dr. House as the captain of some starship doesn't look interesting.
