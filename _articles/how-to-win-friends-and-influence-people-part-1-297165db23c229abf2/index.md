If you want others to like you, think about why they did what they did, accept their shortcomings, and make it a rule never to criticize them openly.

If you want others to do you favors, show your appreciation frequently and make them feel important.

If you want to make a good first impression, smile.

A person's name is the sweetest sound they know. Make it a point to remember people's names and use them often.

If you want to be interesting yourself, be a good listener who is genuinely interested in others. Stop talking and let others do most of the talking so you can focus on listening.

"You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you." --Dale Carnegie

Think about what others want and talk about what's important to them.

Avoid all arguments--they cannot be won.

Never tell others they are wrong; they will only resent you.

Whenever you're wrong yourself, admit it right away.

To be convincing, start in a friendly way and get others to say "yes" as often as possible.

To change others, start with praise and lavish them with more continously.

When drawing attention to mistakes, do so indirectly and speak of your own errors first.
