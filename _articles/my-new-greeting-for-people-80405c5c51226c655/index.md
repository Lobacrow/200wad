Greetings have become automatic. The questions and the answers are really just filler. 

> How are you?

> How's it going?

Most people have stock answers for these questions that they respond with regardless of whether they are actually true. 

As an experiment for a day I answered the question, "How are you?" with "Not good." I was amazed by how many people didn't even acknowledge that answer. A few people picked up on the "not" and asked follow up questions. Some people just assumed my answer was "good" without actually listening to what I said.

My point is that I am working toward taking meaningful actions. I have decided to use a new greeting with people. 

> How did you sleep last night?

I like this question because it is novel. How often has someone asked you how well you slept? This question also solicits thinking. When I have asked this question, most people actually stop and think and answer honestly. This sometimes leads to a conversation about the importance of sleep and allows me to share some tips I have learned on my own journey to improving sleep.

I like helping people and adding value to people's lives. A simple change to a common greeting can take a previously unremarkable moment and transform it into a real conversation that can lead to great things.
