I listened to the latest episode of Seth Godin's podcast _Akimbo_ and heard a statistic that shocked me.

**58% of adults in the US will never pay for and read a book after they graduate from high school.**

I've only read three books so far in 2019, and I was feeling like I'm behind until I heard that statistic. 

You see the stories on _Business Insider_ and in _Success_ magazine about billionaires and successful people describing their love of reading.

*   Bill Gates read a book a week during his career.  
    
*   Warren Buffett has said he invested 80% of this time in reading and thinking.  
    
*   Mark Cuban reads three hours per day.
*   Zig Ziglar read three hours per day.
*   Tim Ferriss reads three to four books per _week_.

Success leaves clues. If you want to be successful, observe what successful people are doing and do that. Without question, regular reading is a habit worth establishing.

"But I don't have time to read." 

Stop with the excuses. Even former President Barack Obama carved out one hour per day to read. 

Reading articles online is not the same as reading books. If you are not currently reading a book, I would highly suggest you start reading one. Start small with a book on a topic that is very interesting to you. Buy a book or check out a book from the library or borrow a book from someone. Get that book in your grubby hands and make a commitment to yourself to read every day.
