I was talking to my brother Mark recently who is very curious about the keto diet I have been following. He was asking if I had some documents or resources he could take a look at. I said sure no problem, and I promptly emailed some documents to his wife Pat since he doesn't use email.

Pat replied to my email and said the email did not contain anything. So, instead of sending a bunch of documents, I attached just one and asked her to confirm that she received it. Her reply, "Nope nothing came through. Mark said just mail it to me."

Such a simple request. I've gotten used to technology. Even faxing a document is a hassle, much less actually printing it and mailing it?

So now I need to print out all the documents. It will be multiple pages, so the documents won't fit in a standard envelope. This means I need one of those large brown envelopes, which if I don't have one I'll need to get one. Better get a few and stock up. Once I have the documents ready, I'll also need to include a personal note in the envelope. 

Then it's the trip to the post office. But I'll need to go inside because I don't know how much the postage will cost, and I don't want to waste stamps or risk not having enough stamps.  

I want my family to have accurate information. It might be a hassle for me, but it might be something that becomes a life-changer for someone else. 

Just mail it to me. Indeed.
