> I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.

For me, one of the benefits of meditation has been increasing awareness of what I am thinking. I am able to identify when I start to have negative thought patterns like worrying. The goal isn't to suppress these thoughts, but to recognize them so that I can deal with them.

I am not an anxious person, but I have recognized a lot of worrying about things that simply do not matter or never come to pass.
