I have been using AirPods Pro for calls since I have been working at home. I like them for the convenience and issue-free performance. The only problem is that the batteries do not last. I sometimes have back-to-back-to-back meetings or meetings that go on for multiple hours. The AirPods don't even last three hours now, and the only way to charge them is to put them in a case. Queue the search for alternatives.

I decided to go with over-the-ear headphones instead of earbuds due to the battery issue. Priority one is to find headphones that are built for calls. I need crystal-clear call quality both on my end and for everyone else listening to me. Second priority is battery life. Ideally, I want the headphones to last all day before I need to charge them. Noise-cancelling would be nice but not a deal-breaker. 

I know Bose headphones are the gold standard, but I wanted to find something cheaper. I finally landed on the Jabra Elite 85h headphones, which were $149 after a $50 discount on Amazon. I'm happy to say I landed on the right headphones. The reported battery life is up to 36 hours, and this seems to be accurate. I have been using the headphones for multiple hours of calls since Sunday and they are still at 74% charge. The bluetooth pairing works like a charm, and the call quality is great. 

Sorry AirPods. I'll still use you when I'm working out and for "knock around" activity, but I need a better workhorse for work.
