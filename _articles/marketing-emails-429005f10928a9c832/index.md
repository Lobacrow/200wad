I got an email from Chase Card Services with the following subject: "Brandon, you've been selected to upgrade and earn 5,000 bonus points."

Nice touch using my name in the subject, but I immediately recognize it as a marketing email because my regular emails never have my name in the subject. Another sneaky trick companies use is to start the subject with "RE" as if they are replying to YOUR email.

The offer is to upgrade to the Rapid Rewards Priority Credit Card. I already have the regular Rapid Rewards Credit Card for Southwest Airlines. This offer makes it sound like something special for just me, but anyone who has a Rapid Rewards credit card can upgrade to the Priority version (assuming you have a high enough credit score). The Priority credit card has an annual fee of $149, up from $99 for the regular Rapid Rewards card. So you start out down $50 per year.

How much are Southwest points worth? According to Nerdwallet, 1 point = 1.4 cents. So 5,000 = $70. Okay, so that makes up for the annual fee increase of $50, for the first year. The premier card gives me 6,000 points on my anniversary. The priority card offers 7,500 points. That's a $21 dollar value difference.

I could go on and on about the comparisons between cards, but in the end, I'm not going to be flying for a long time so why bother switching?
