Where are all the (legal) get-rich-quick schemes? I have seen so many presentations and sales pitches where they make it a point to say, "Hey, now this isn't some get-rich-quick scheme...." Well, why not? Of course, the word "rich" is relative.

It's certainly possible to get broke quickly. Anyone who has played the stock market knows how fast you can lose money. So, at least from a logical perspective, if money can be lost that fast why can't it be gained equally fast? Why is it that there is some governor on how fast you can make money? Somehow if you make money "too fast," then people immediately think it's illegal or some scam. 

Maybe the idea is that it takes money as an accelerator to gain more money faster. Even if you have some in-demand products, you still need the resources to manufacture them and get them into people's hands. 

I am reminded of the message displayed on every slot machine in a casino: "Malfunction voids all pays and plays." If you win a jackpot, they check that machine up and down and make sure nothing went wrong before they pay you. But you notice no one checks the machine while you keep losing?
