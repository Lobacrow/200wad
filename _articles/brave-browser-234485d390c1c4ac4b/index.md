When the 200WAD site suddenly became verboten for the Safari web browser recently, I decided to try out the new Brave browser on the advice of a friend of mine. The Safari issue is fixed, but I am still test-driving Brave.

The Brave browser purports to be a more secure web browser with robust privacy controls. The item I notice the most is blocking of 3rd-party trackers. In fact, on 200WAD I notice one being blocked--googletagmanager.com--whatever that is.Â 

The other feature of the Brave browser is integration with something called a Basic Attention Token (BAT). You can read all about it [here](https://basicattentiontoken.org/). The idea of BAT is blockchain-based digital advertising. Users can earn tokens for viewing ads for which the data are anonymized via the blockchain. Users can also contribute tokens to content creators

@basilesamel perhaps you can configure 200WAD to make use of the BAT as a potential income stream. I have no idea what that entails, but on the user side setting up the BAT rewards and wallet couldn't have been easier. So far I have earned 0.45 BAT worth a whopping $0.11. Then again, I have the number of ads dialed down.
