_Super Human - The Bulletproof Plan to Age Backward and Maybe Even Live Forever_ is a brand new book by Dave Asprey. Dave Asprey is the founder of Bulletproof, Inc., of the same Bulletproof coffee fame. Dave is considered the father of "biohacking," which he defines as follows:

_biohacking - changing the environment inside of and around you to gain control of your own biology_

Dave has famously said that he wants to live to be 180 years old, and he wants to do everything he can to ensure he remains lucid and vital right up until the end.

I read the Introduction and Chapter One of this book and already have some great content to share.

The thesis of _Super Human_ is comprised of three parts:

1\. Don't die - Identify the biological factors that cause most of the diseases of aging and stop them or at least slow them down.

2\. Age backward - Use strategies ranging from simple to cutting edge that will add more years to your life and more life to your years.

3\. Heal like a deity - True anti-aging techniques that will allow you to heal your mind and body for longevity

**Part I: Don't Die** opens with this quote:

> Widen your relationship to time, slow it down. Don't see time as an enemy but an ally. It provides you with perspective. Aging doesn't frighten you. Time is your teacher. --Robert Greene, _The Laws of Human Nature_

**Chapter One - The Four Killers**

Statistically, if you do not die in a car crash or from opioid addiction, chances are one of the Four Killers is going to drain your life and your energy (and your retirement fund) before you die in a hospital.

If you are average...

*   You have a 23 percent risk of dying from **heart disease**.
*   You have a 25 percent risk of **diabetes**.
*   You have a 10 percent risk of developing **Alzheimer's**.
*   You have a 40 percent risk of **cancer** and a 20 percent risk of dying from it.

Each chapter ends with action steps, so let's get straight to those.

*   If you have joint pain or blood sugar issues, consider taking glucosamine, which helps control blood sugar and extends the lifespan of mice (and probably humans). BW--I knew about glucosamine for joints, but the beneficial effect for blood sugar is new to me. I will absolutely do more research to determine whether I need to add this supplement to my daily regimen.
*   Consume more antioxidants to fight off free radicals. Berries, herbs, spices, coffee, tea, and dark chocolate are good sources. There are also medical spas in most cities that offer antioxidant therapy via IV. BW--The benefit of antioxidants is well known. Considering that I travel a lot, I may research a medical spa to get a concentrated dose of antioxidants and measure the results.Â 
*   Short periods of fasting stimulate autophagy and have longevity benefits. BW: Fasting is one of the key tools I use to manage ketones and blood sugar levels. I will be curious to read more about fasting protocols to see whether there is any research supporting particularly effective fasting windows.
*   To help with cardiovascular issues, try the Zona Plus, a digitally controlled handheld device that uses the science behind isometric exercise to increase both vascular flexibility (thus decreasing blood pressure) and the production and flow of nitric oxide throughout the body. It's a cool biohack for anyone who wants to improve their cardiovascular health. BW--This is the first time I heard of this tool, and I'm definitely going to research it.
*   The area of functional genomics is the study of your genome to determine what you can actually do to influence risk. Dave received a review of his genome from the DNA Company that provided him with practical steps to address physiological issues based on his genetic profile. BW--While I'm not a fan of surrendering my DNA to any company, I do see the value in using today's genetic tools to a) discover any genetic deficiencies and b) use the information to take action to improve my biology.

Chapter Two is called The Seven Pillars of Aging and up next. I really can't wait for Chapter Four: Sleep or Die. Loving this book so far!
