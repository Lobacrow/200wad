One of the tricks companies have been using to entice buyers is to provide some sort of free gift with the order. Sometimes it's free with any purchase. Sometimes they require you to meet a particular threshold. What I have noticed for companies from whom I have purchased is that the free gift isn't something I want anyway.

Take for example the company FBOMB, which makes keto snacks. They have something called Keto Crunch, which are high-fat cheese crisps. Keto Crunch comes in a variety of flavors. I like most of the flavors, but my least favorite is salt and vinegar. I used to eat salt and vinegar potato chips, but for some reason that flavor doesn't work for me in Keto Crunch. 

So I see the email with "Black Friday early access" indicating that if I spend at least $65, I'll get a free case of salt and vinegar Keto Crunch. That may work on a new customer, but I know better. The free gift is not something I want anyway. 

You notice the free gift is never the marquis product. My hunch is that the company has stale inventory and they are trying to get rid of it. Well, if someone likes salt and vinegar Keto Crunch, that is certainly the deal for you!
