Most people start their careers in entry-level jobs making minimum wage or a modest amount. The dream, of course, is to do a good job, get promoted, and eventually make more money. 

You start out measuring raises in cents. You talk about getting a twenty-five-cent raise or a fifty-cent raise. Eventually, you might move from an hourly job to a salaried job, otherwise known as an "exempt" position. Say goodbye to overtime (and for many people much of your free time) in these positions. But your raises are now measured as a percentage of salary or dollar amount added to your annual salary. But you don't care about that number. You care about the number in your paycheck. Sure, $2500 per year increase sounds like a lot, until you look at your check and see the net amount went up by $40.

When you make a modest salary, you have more freedom to move. You can swap one job for another, even in different industries, because the pay is similar. Once you start moving up the ladder and making more money, it becomes more difficult to get off the train. Most people live the lifestyle afforded by their salary or as divorce lawyers like to say, "the lifestyle to which one has become accustomed." 

Don't let this happen to you. Don't stay in an industry you don't like just for the money or a false sense of security. One day you'll be happy with your finances but you'll be unfulfilled. 

How do you break out of this vicious cycle? You start working on yourself. You educate yourself. You become better physically and mentally. You reduce your lifestyle and save money to plan for an eventual exit. And you make the most of your free time to pursue things that matter. 

Then you take the leap and do it. You show people what is possible. Then you do whatever you can to help others do the same thing. 

The cat's out of the bag now. This is my game plan. I'm not where I want to be yet, but I've got a plan to get there.
