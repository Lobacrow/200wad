There were so many great sponsors for the Virtual Biohacking Conference a few weeks back that I could have really gone off the rails with purchases. Instead, I limited myself to one device for the body and one device for the brain.Â 

For the body, I purchased something called the [Hypersphere](https://hyperice.com/hypersphere). This is a rechargeable vibrating sphere that is about 5 inches in diameter. It has three speeds, but I don't even use the highest setting because [#2](#2) is about all I can handle. One of the hardest areas to address by yourself is the upper back, neck, and shoulders. This ball is perfect for that area. I lie on the floor, turn it on and lie my shoulder/upper back on it using my body weight to control the pressure. I can roll along the ball until it hits the knots, and when I find one it KILLS. I just have to endure it until the kinks are worked out, and then it's tremendous relief afterward. It's quite amazing how effective this relatively simple technology is.

I'm a big believe in vibration therapy and will cover that topic in a future newsletter.

Oh, and the gadget for the brain? I haven't used it enough to give my impressions.
