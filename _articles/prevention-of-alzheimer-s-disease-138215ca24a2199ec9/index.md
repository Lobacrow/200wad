Recently I listened to an [episode of Dr. Peter Attia's podcast](https://peterattiamd.com/richardisaacson/) addressing Alzheimer's disease. Peter's guest was Richard Isaacson, a neurologist who specializes in Alzheimer's disease. 

> Anyone with a brain is at risk for Alzheimer's. --Richard Isaacson

It is somewhat scary to think that your actions and behaviors now will affect your health and quality of life 20-30 years in the future. Richard indicated that some people may start to show the biological changes that are related to Alzheimer's disease twenty or more years before showing symptoms. 

One fact that surprised me is that only recently has there even been an acknowledgement in the scientific community about _prevention_ of Alzheimer's disease. In fact, scientific journals used to refuse to publish articles if they used the phrase "Alzheimer's prevention." They wanted the word "prevention" changed to "risk reduction."

Many people plan for retirement to ensure they have enough money in their golden years. But how many people plan for health? Sure, there are plenty of diseases and afflictions that you cannot control, but scientific data are becoming more and more clear that behavior and lifestyle choices have a huge effect on overall health and wellbeing. 

Knowledge is not power. Knowing is not enough. So what am I doing with this knowledge?

My Action steps:

*   Continue my relentless focus on reversing type 2 diabetes
*   Stay focused on getting good quality sleep every night
*   Learn more about Alzheimer's prevention (starting with https://www.alzu.org) and learn about longevity medicine
*   Get more specific lab tests including ApoE genetic test and NMR Lipoprofile to determine my risk profile
