This time around I'm writing a preview for the Vice Presidential debate this evening. Normally, I would not be interested in watching a VP debate. Vice President Mike Pence is not exactly Mr. Personality, and I'm not expecting anything surprising from him. I don't know enough about Kamala Harris, so this will be my opportunity to learn more about her. The VP's are particularly important right now because of the status of the other two.

Donald Trump is 74 years old, at least overweight if not obese, and was diagnosed with COVID. In other words, no spring chicken. Joe Biden will be 78 next month, which is coincidentally the average life expectancy in the US. Say what you will about Joe, it would be a tall order for a perfectly fit and vibrant 78 yr old to endure four years of pressure from the presidency, much less someone who is clearly past his prime.

There are taking extra precautions for tonight's debate, including putting up plexiglass barriers between the candidates. I saw one news report that referred to this change as "controversial." What's so controversial about it? Every check-out lane at the grocery store has them. So what?
