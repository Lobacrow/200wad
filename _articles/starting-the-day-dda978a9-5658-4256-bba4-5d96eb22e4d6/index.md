Much has been said about morning routines and what people should be doing after they wake up in the morning. I want to fast forward to moment when you sign on to the computer.Â 

One of the many great things about the Mac is that when I log in, I'm greeted with a clean screen. No automatic-opening of apps or windows. It's a clean start, and I decide what to do.

Contrast this with the PC, which has always been a nightmare when you log in. Outlook wants to launch first, pushing all your emails right into your face. I did fix that one so it doesn't launch right away anymore. Internet Explorer was another culprit that launched some homepage (usually MSNBC) to distract you. I took care of that one as well. The latest culprit is Microsoft Teams, which has eluded my efforts to stop from launching at log-in. I cannot stand having the Teams window forced open in front of me with all of these lingering conversations that I can't seem to get rid of. I'm sure there is a way to resolve these issues, but who has time for how-tos (and also fiction)?
