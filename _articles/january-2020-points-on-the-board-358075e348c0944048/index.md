I generally eschew summary posts, mainly because I like to be contrarian. There is value, however, in pausing to reflect what I've accomplished to contribute to my overall theme of 2020: Points on the board.

The biggest point on the board in January was creating my Facebook page [Improve Your Sleep](https://www.facebook.com/Getyourzzzs/?view_public_for=112095793657211) on January 11. The page has accumulated 104 followers (no they are not all my friends on Facebook.) I got some traction with some boosted ads, and I will continue refining the definition of my audience to target the right people. I also need to constantly work on content besides my usual words to keep things fresh and interesting.

The Facebook course has been great, but I am behind the "class march." Each week there are "office hours" and live videos about the module for that week. This week was Module 3, and I haven't even finished Module 2. I don't think this course is aimed at people with full-time jobs who are starting from scratch. The page and group chatter is too much. These people LIVE on Facebook.

I completed Chapter 8 in my nutrition course. The chapters are getting quite dense now, and my progress has slowed as I am trying to understand the content rather than just blaze through it. The goal here is to complete all 20 chapters to become Precision Nutrition Level 1 Certified to have as a credential and provide me with a bit of credibility in the health and wellness space since this has not been my career.

Not much progress on the book in January. This needs to change if I am to meet my goal of publishing it in 2020. On to February!
