I had a busy day today, and this evening I exchanged gifts with my neighbor. We chit chatted for a while and now it's sleepy time. Well, almost sleepy time. It's a priority to stick to my sleep schedule, but it's also a priority to write every day. This is one of the rare times when these two high-priority items conflict with each other.

On top of the infringement on my schedule, I'm also exposing myself to excessive blue light from the computer screen. I should have put on my True Dark glasses.

I overheard someone bragging about how he gets by on four hours of sleep per night. Of course, from my point of view, it's odd to brag about chronic sleep deprivation. No, that guy is probably not one of the rare people with the genetic mutation that allows them to function normally on such little sleep.Â 

According to the app for my Oura ring, my sleep latency has been good the last several days. Sleep latency is the time it takes for you to fall asleep. Ideally, it should not take more than 15-20 minutes to fall asleep. Also, if you fall asleep too quickly (less than 5 minutes), that could be a sign of sleep deprivation.
