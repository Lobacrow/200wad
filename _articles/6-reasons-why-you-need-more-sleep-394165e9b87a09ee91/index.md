1.  **Your mood** - Sufficient sleep allows your brain time to process emotions.
2.  **Your heart** - Blood pressure drops when you sleep. The less sleep you get, the longer your blood pressure stays elevated, which is harder on the heart and cardiovascular system.
3.  **Your immune system** - The immune cells are more effective and better able to provide a healthy response after a good night of sleep.
4.  **Your muscles** - Proper sleep provides recovery after workouts to allow the body to repair itself.
5.  **Your diet -** When you are not getting enough sleep, you're more likely to be swayed by hormones that control your appetite. You will also tend to crave bad foods.
6.  **Your brain** - Sufficient sleep allows brains to learn better and helps consolidate memories so that you remember more of what you learn.
