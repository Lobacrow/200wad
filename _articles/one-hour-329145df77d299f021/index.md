A one-hour timeshift is enough to disrupt my sleep schedule. When I travel to California from Arizona, the clock goes back one hour. It still feels later to me, so I end up going to bed earlier and waking up earlier. This morning I was up wide awake at 4 AM. Did I stay in bed and toss and turn for an hour? Absolutely not. I will cover the topic of "sleep hygiene" in more detail in my book.

I will admit I do not have a regular writing schedule. Gary Keller in his interview with Tim Ferriss that I [wrote about yesterday](https://200wordsaday.com/words/tim-ferriss-interviews-gary-keller-328645df676f26d5aa) said that he focuses on accomplishing the most important tasks early in the day. This allows him to be spontaneous later in the day and not feel guilty because he accomplished the most important things. In other words, business before pleasure.

> Treat something like a business, it will pay you. Treat something like a hobby, it will cost you. 

If I did a time study of my posts, I would bet most of the sub-par ones were written at the end of the day. It's time to change this. 

As @keni wrote about recently, it's time to add some resistance to my daily practice.
