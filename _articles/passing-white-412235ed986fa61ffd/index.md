I am half-white and half-Hispanic. My mom is Mexican, born in the US to Mexican immigrants. My dad referred to himself as a "hillbilly from Virginia." When people ask me my nationality, I used to joke, "If you're going to give me money, I'm Hispanic. If you're going to deport me, I'm white."

I learned of a new phrase recently that apparently describes me. If you are of mixed race and can "pass" for a white person, you are said to be _passing white_. I suppose on official documents I classify myself as "white" or "caucasian" but with a Hispanic origin. 

I don't identify with a particular culture or race of people other than being an American. I'm not sure where that puts me in the current conversation on race relations that has displaced the coronavirus from the headlines.

I'm not sure whether there is any cause that I feel strongly enough about that I would be out protesting for or against. I know you're not supposed to say something like that but it's how I feel.

I do like Mitch Hedberg's line about protesting: 

> I'm against picketing but I don't know how to show it.
