Project Food as Fuel was the challenge I embarked upon to radically change my diet and reverse type 2 diabetes. I succeeded, but it's not the end of the story. I realized that an extreme ketogenic diet is not sustainable for the long haul. I need to be very deliberate about crafting the diet that I will stick to for the rest of my life.

Some assumptions:

*   While the diet will not be strictly ketogenic, I did well with low-carb and will continue with moderate protein and high fat.
*   I still need to lose about 30 pounds to get to my ideal weight, so I need to reduce calories from my current level.
*   Since I will not be traveling for the foreseeable future, I will establish a diet that works well at home and then modify it if and when I start traveling again.
*   I will need to cook and prepare meals more than I'm used to and consider how this will affect my schedule.

How I'm crafting my diet
------------------------

I'm starting with a blank spreadsheet, and I will create separate food lists from various sources.

*   I took a gut microbiome test from Viome, which provided me with a report of recommended foods.
*   I took a genetic test with Geno Palate, which also provided me with a report of recommended foods.
*   I will use the Virta recommended foods list, which was the basis of the ketogenic diet that I followed for a year.
*   I will use Dr. Daniel Amen's Bright Minds diet, which lists foods that are particularly important for brain health.
*   I will use recommendations from the Bulletproof Diet, which is a low-carb, whole-foods diet.

After I cross-reference these lists with my own preferences and land on a master food list, I will use the list to develop a standard set of recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks.Â 

Yes, this is a lot of effort but it's worth it to keep my mind and body healthy as long as possible.
