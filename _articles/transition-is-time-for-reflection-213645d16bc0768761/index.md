As much as we complain about the daily grind and mundane nature of work and life sometimes, it is interesting how we feel when we arrive at a transition. 

It is nearly the end of June. Tomorrow is the last session of the SQL class I have been delivering for the last seven weeks. It's been a good run, and I know I have delivered value for the participants. I have looked forward to class every week. That said, it will be nice to have my Saturday mornings back.

I am also transitioning from one role to another with my client. The new role is a manager role that should be interesting. I'm ready for a change and a challenge.

A transition is nothing to be afraid of. It's a good time to reflect. Tally up the accomplishments. Analyze decisions, mistakes, failures and not dwell on them but learn from them. 

Project Food as Fuel is humming along. I have been branching out and testing the boundaries of how my body reacts now that I am two months in. 

I'm taking a brief pause this weekend for some self reflection during this transition. After that, I will be geared up and ready to bring on what's next.
