_The Office_ is one of the great comedy series of all time. I know some people insist that the original UK version is the best, but I have not watched enough of it to make that assessment. For some reason, the processing power it takes for me to understand British accents takes away from my full appreciation of UK programming.

I watched many episodes of the US version when the show was airing between 2005-2013, but I know I missed some along the way. I decided to go back and binge-watch the whole series on Netflix. It was worth it. 

What makes _The Office_ different from other shows is that it was portrayed as a documentary, so the actors acknowledge the cameras. This makes for some classic scenes with hilarious facial expressions. 

The characters are brilliantly portrayed, and the dialog and crazy situations make me laugh hysterically. Some of the things that happen in this office would never happen in a real office, but it somehow fits within the context of the show.  The writers definitely have my sense of humor pinned down. 

As you might imagine I'm also a fan of the movie _Office Space_, which explores similar mundane themes of office life in a humorous, albeit more vulgar manner.
