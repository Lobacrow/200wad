Years ago I didn't go to the dentist regularly, and I paid for it in the form of gum disease. I required an unpleasant procedure called "scaling and root planing" followed by periodontal maintenance every four months. Once you have gum disease you need to have it addressed, otherwise you are opening yourself up to bone loss, tooth loss, and a variety of other health problems.

I learned my lesson, and now I visit the dentist every six months. Today was my semi-annual visit. I received good news and bad news.

Good news: My gums are in great shape. The dental hygenist performed a depth check on both sides of all teeth, and everything was in the standard range of 1-3 mm. This is the "pocket depth" of the gums around the teeth. When the depth reaches 4 and higher, this is a signal for problems. At my worst, I had teeth at 6 and 7 mm. 

Bad news: I told the dentist that over the last couple of months I've had some sensitivity on a lower left molar. He identified it as a tooth for which I had a filling one year ago. The problem is that the tooth is cracked, so I'm going to need a crown.

I would say one of the worst things to hear at the dentist's office is that you need a root canal. The second worst thing to hear is you need a crown. 

The first thought is, okay how much? Without insurance, it would be nearly $2,000. With insurance, it amounts to about $900, but I'm lucky they have a special going on that if I donate some canned goods for a food drive, they will take 20% off the bill. I'll take it! 

I already have a crown on a front tooth, so I know the drill (pun intended). On Monday, I am scheduled for the first phase, which is to get a mold of the tooth being replaced. They will also grind down my existing tooth and put a temporary crown on it. The crown is custom made, and then I will return in two weeks for the final fitting. The crown fits over the existing tooth with the root still intact.

This issue was unexpected. But life happens. I'm glad I didn't have something painful happen while I was out of town. I'm glad I have insurance and the money to pay for the crown. While I'm at it, I'm glad I am able to procure delicious food to make full use of my choppers.
