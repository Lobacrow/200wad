At my current client I work with another consultant who is from India. He has lived in the US for several years on a work visa. He learned English as a child, so his English is very good even though he speaks with a pretty thick accent.

I had a hard time understanding him at first, especially on the phone. After working with him for awhile it became easier. Some people have said they would rather communicate with him through email because they can't understand him in person. I wonder what perception those people have of him. 

Here's a guy who wasn't born in the US but lives here and has a family here. He speaks six languages. He is in the queue for a green card, but he said his number isn't scheduled to come up for _seventeen years_. At some point his work visa will not be renewed, and he will have to go back to India for at least a year before he returns to the US. 

I'm trying to imagine what it would be like relocating to a country outside the US, finding meaningful work, and speaking a different language. I wonder how I would be perceived by others. 

My perception of my work colleague has changed after working with him for 2.5 months. I was reminded not to make assumptions and to give people the benefit of the doubt, especially when they are willing to do things that maybe I wouldn't be willing to do.
