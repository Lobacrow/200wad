We all want to be healthy. We all have a pretty good idea of how to be healthy with various lifestyle choices. So the desire is there. The knowledge is there. What stops us from actually making it happen?

I avoided the doctor for years. I figured if I didn't really feel bad or have any issues then I should be fine. The turning point for me was participating in personal development training and hearing over and over again just how important good health is. Every trainer, every speaker was fit and healthy. Surely that wasn't a coincidence.

In September of 2018, I finally went to the doctor for a wellness visit. \*SPOILER ALERT\* My lab work indicated that I have type 2 diabetes. 

I have been wanting to publish an article about this on Medium for a long time and have struggled.

Then I realized the power of the streak. Writing consistently every day for a month on this platform got me "unstuck." The wheels started turning and in just a couple days I was able to finish my article.

I am happy to share this story with you in the hopes that you will get "unstuck" too.  Believe in the power of the streak. And believe in your own power to make positive changes in your life.
