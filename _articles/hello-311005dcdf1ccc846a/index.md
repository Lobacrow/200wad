"You must be Brandon."

"I am. Come in. Welcome to my living room."

"Oh wow, lots to see. Is that your parents?"

"That's the last pic I have with both of them. My father died in 2014."

"My condolences. What about this other picture? Uncles?"

"I have four half-brothers. Same mom, different dad. I'm the baby."

"You have lost a lot of weight! I see the whole fitness corner."

"Off all meds and reversing diabetes. I'm an amateur biohacker."

"That's great! Is that your wife?"

"That's my girlfriend, Ann."

"Kids?"

"No kids."

"This part of the room has a midwestern feel to it."

"I was born in Illinois, grew up in Indiana, went to college in Ohio."

"Is that a Valedictorian trophy? Impressive!"

"Yes, but my high school class was only 114."

"A Bachelor's degree from the University of Toledo. Mathematics and Psychology. Odd combination."

"Have you seen the girls in the math classes?"

"Ha! What's this wooden podium?"

"I used to teach middle school."

"Is that the original iPhone?! Are those ALL iPhones??"

"Yes, every iPhone I've owned."

"I see luggage."Â 

"I travel a lot as an IT consultant for work, but I'd rather travel for fun."

"That is a TON of books! Why is that one bookshelf empty?"

"That's for the books I'm going to write."

"What's your favorite quote from the wall?"

"Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment." -- Jim Rohn
