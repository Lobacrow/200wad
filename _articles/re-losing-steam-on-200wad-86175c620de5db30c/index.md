I find the more books and articles I read and the more podcasts I listen to, the more ideas I have to write about. When the well is dry sitting at a blank post for 200WAD, that tells me I have been slacking off with other activities. @BasileSamel mentioned that he gets ideas from writing, but it doesn't usually work that way for me. 

Certain things feel like work, but I know I have to do them anyway. Working out is the classic example. I definitely do not enjoy it. I'm the guy who has nightmares that I'm back in PE class in high school. But I do it because I want the result. I want the improved health that comes with physical activity. So I trudge through it. Maybe one day it won't feel like work, but today it does.

I definitely enjoy writing. For many years I captured quirky observances I made throughout the week and sent weekly summaries to coworkers just because I enjoyed doing it. I have published longer articles on Medium without any monetary gain. I enjoy writing a post each day on 200WAD. This doesn't feel like work. I suppose if my main job were all writing then maybe I would feel differently. 

That said, there are times when I sit down to write a longer article or work on an ebook and I am just not into it in that moment. Who knows what the reason is. So even though I enjoy writing, there are times when I'm just not that into it. I think that's normal. It could be wishful thinking, but I feel like writing on 200WAD has led to fewer of those moments. 

@jasonleow I suppose only time time will tell whether this is an endeavor that you want to continue to pursue. Race you to 100 days ;)
