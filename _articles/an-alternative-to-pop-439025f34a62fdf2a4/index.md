I call it pop. Some call it soda. Some call it soda pop. Steve Jobs once called it sugar water when he was trying to convince the President of Pepsi John Sculley. to join Apple. That's probably the best description because that is what it is: sugar and water.

Years ago I drank pop all the time. As far as the Pepsi Challenge goes, I'm a Coke fan all the way. Coca Cola Classic. Nothing better than an ice-cold fountain Coke. None of this New Coke or Clear Coke nonsense. And if you want the best tasting Coke, head over to [McDonald's](https://www.myrecipes.com/news/why-mcdonalds-coke-tastes-better). 

At some point, I deliberately cut back on pop, which turned out to be a good move.

One 12-oz can of Coke contains 9.75 teaspoons or 39 grams of sugar in the form of high-fructose corn syrup. 

The American Heart Association recommends the following maximum amount of added sugar per day: 

Men: 9 teaspoons (35 grams)

Women: 6 teaspoons (25 grams)

Yikes. Pure empty calories. Pure sugar. 

What about diet drinks? Well nowadays if I decide to have a Coke I will go with a Coke Zero, which tastes better to me than Diet Coke. The problem with diet soda is the use of artificial sweeteners. No sugar, no calories, and still no nutrition. There are some studies that indicate these sweeteners are not good for your gut microbiome. 

You can't win. Or can you? 

I live in the desert. I eat a low-carb, ketogenic diet. I travel a lot for work. These are three great reasons to stay hydrated, and I do my best. But after drinking all that plain water for so long, it gets a bit boring.

This calls for a bit of the bubbbblay! Enter carbonated water, which is created by injecting water with carbon dioxide. There are several types of carbonated water.

**Club soda** - Carbonated water with added minerals, which give a slightly salty taste.

**Seltzer** - Carbonated water without added minerals. This is just water infused with carbon dioxide.

**Sparkling mineral water** - Water that is naturally carbonated from a spring or well. This water naturally contains minerals.

**Tonic water** - This is club soda that contains an additional ingredient - quinine, which gives it a bitter taste. Tonic water and club soda are both common mixers used with alcoholic drinks.

Here's the thing. If you are used to drinking regular or diet soda, when you taste plain seltzer you probably aren't going to like it. You get the fizz but no sweetness and no taste. But when you add a hint of flavor, it's a game-changer. 

I carry packets of True Lemon with me in case I need a bit of flavor in my water. Each packet of True Lemon contains crystallized lemon and is the equivalent of squeezing one lemon wedge. On a plane, I order seltzer water and add a packet of True Lemon for a refreshing if not momentary reprieve from cramped seats and stale air.

My current favorite sparkling mineral water is Topo Chico with Lime, and I can get it on the road at Chipotle. 

Carbonated water without sugar or artificial sweeteners but with a hint of fruit flavor is my alternative to pop.

It's a year later and I'm still drinking primarily unsweetened sparkling water. Over the July 4th holiday, I actually popped open a can of regular Sprite and couldn't finish it. I could not believe how sweet it tasted to me. It seems I have re-wired my taste buds so that I not only tolerate unsweetened sparkling water but I prefer it.

My favorite flavors are in the citrus family (lemon, lime, orange, grapefruit) or the berry family (raspberry, cherry, strawberry). Curiously, while I like the actual flavors of these fruits, I'm not actually a "fruit person." I don't want to eat the whole fruits, I just want to taste the flavor. It's just as well because I don't need all the fructose anyway, and I'll have to find a different way to keep up the fiber intake.

I've also become one of those people who eschews ice-cold water. There is something not quite right about the crown I had put on in November of last year because it is highly sensitive to cold. I have been back to the dentist twice trying to fix the problem, and both experiences were very unpleasant and did not fix it. I'm not sure what the next step is, but I'm just living with the irritation at the moment.
