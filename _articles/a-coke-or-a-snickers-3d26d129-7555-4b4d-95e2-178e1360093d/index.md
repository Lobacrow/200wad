In January I wrote a post in which I explored the answer to this question: Which is better, a Coke or a Snickers? Now I suppose that is a loaded question because we all know both a Coke and Snickers are just junk foods with empty calories and too much sugar. But hey, if you want to have one, one is at least marginally better for you than the other one.

I expounded upon this topic for my newsletter this week. It is interesting to revisit a draft that I wrote here and compare it to a more polished version for my newsletter. For those who are interested, here is my original draft: [https://writelier.com/which-is-better-a-coke-or-a-snickers-342765e171d4b4625d](https://writelier.com/which-is-better-a-coke-or-a-snickers-342765e171d4b4625d)

Here is the newsletter version: [https://bewellthy.substack.com/p/which-is-worse-a-coke-or-a-snickers](https://bewellthy.substack.com/p/which-is-worse-a-coke-or-a-snickers)

The newsletter on Substack is more like Medium with pictures and some additional formatting. Previously it would take me several weeks or months to crank out one Medium article. Now I'm writing an article of the same type and quality on a weekly basis. I guess all this exercise in the form of writing every day does have a payoff.
