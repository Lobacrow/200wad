The other day I was scrolling on either Facebook or Instagram and saw an ad for a sleep mask. Apparently the algorithms have figured out that I have a big interest in the topic of sleep. It just so happens I was coming off a particularly bad week on the road with a hotel room that was not conducive to good sleep. It turns out a sleep mask is something I need to add to my sleep routine on the road.

I clicked the link to view the company’s website. I was idle for a short time on the website when suddenly a pop-up appeared asking for my email address for a 10% off coupon. I promptly gave my address to get the coupon, purchased the mask and saved 10%, and then immediately unsubscribed from the email list. 

You should avoid paying the full price for anything especially anything you buy online. You can use tools like pricegrabber.com or camel camel camel to search for the lowest prices. You should also search for discount codes to apply to your purchases. 

Now, some would agree with me that time is more valuable than money. Perhaps for you saving a dollar isn’t worth the time it takes to search for deals or discount codes. That is a decision you need to make for yourself. 

Any time you buy the newest version of a product it will most likely cost the most. Consider whether you need to buy the brand new version of a product, which is especially true for electronics. As soon as the brand new versions are released, the previous versions are immediately discounted. In addition, Version 1.0 of a product usually has issues. Unless you are an early-adopter, perhaps it’s better for you to wait until all the bugs are worked out and you will save money by waiting.

Also consider the best times to buy certain items. You can always find deals for seasonal items at the end of the season, e.g., Christmas ornament sales after Christmas. 

Part of your shopping routine should include a way to buy things for less money. If you are paying full price for an item, consider whether that item is a must-have. Presumably you work hard for your money. Spend it wisely.
