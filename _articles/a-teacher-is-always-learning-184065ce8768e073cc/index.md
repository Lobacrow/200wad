Tomorrow I will deliver session 3 of my SQL class. I will be the first to say that I'm certainly not a SQL expert. According to John Lee Dumas, who went to law school for one semester, if you know more about a particular subject than anyone else in the room, you meet the legal definition of a subject matter expert. I guess in this case I would be deemed the expert. But I'm still learning.

This week I learned some tricks in SQL that I did not know before. It is amazing the free resources that are one quick Google search away to find solutions to problems. 

Even though I'm teaching this course that I developed, I'm still learning. And that's okay. There is a saying:

> If you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room.

It doesn't matter how much you know about a subject, you can always learn more about it. 

You also shouldn't assume that the most people or even some people have the knowledge that you have. I am sure that you have a specific skill or specific knowledge that would benefit others. It doesn't matter whether you are an "expert" or not.

Consider sharing what you know. It doesn't have to be a formal class. It could be as simple as a blog post or a podcast or a YouTube video. You can partner up with someone who has expertise in delivering material. Give it away for free or consider a knowledge business model. This is my current area of entrepreneurial interest.
