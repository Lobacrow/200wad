In January I wrote about how we are in the [Golden Age of Podcasts](https://cowriters.app/words/the-golden-age-of-podcasts-330285df98d43ada70). There is a wide variety of content to suit all tastes, and it's all freely available. Sadly, based on an announcement yesterday, I think we are at the beginning of the end of this golden age.

[Yesterday on the Joe Rogan Experience](https://youtu.be/KluBn073YjY), Joe opened his show by announcing that he signed a multi-year licensing deal with Spotify. Beginning September 1, 2020, both the audio and video versions of his podcast will be available on Spotify as well as the current platforms, e.g., Apple Podcasts and YouTube. At some point late in the year, the transition will be complete and you will only be able to listen to the Joe Rogan Experience with a Spotify subscription.

This, my friends, is a sign of things to come. I predict that podcasts will go the way of radio, television, and movies in that most content will be behind some "walled garden." Every streaming service has exclusive content, and you have to subscribe in order to get it. Podcasts will be the next content medium to succumb to this fate.

I don't blame Joe Rogan. He built a monster podcast from nothing and certainly put in his time over the years. I hope he is getting a truckload of money that will keep him set for life. That said, I don't know that he is enough of a draw for me to sign up for Spotify. I already have Apple Music and am quite happy with it.

Enjoy the golden age of podcasts before it's gone!
