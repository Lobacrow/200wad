I have settled in nicely to the new office. This is the first time I have had an office in my professional career. There's nothing really special about it. I have joked that I just need to get Matt Lauer's guy to install the button under the desk, and I'll be good to go. That reminds me, I need to complete some sort of sexual harassment tips..I mean prevention training.

Some things in the office do not change. For some reason, most people in California are fine with drinking room temperature water. I need to have ice cold water. The only way to get that in the office is to buy a water bottle from the vending machine in the break room or use the ice cubes from the trays in the freezer. The problem with the second option is that even though there are only one or two other people in the office who also enjoy freezing cold beverages, at least one of those people uses a Big Gulp and empties an entire tray of ice cubes at a clip. There is a premium on ice cubes, which I discovered today when I opened the freezer to discover all three trays filled with water instead of ice cubes. Maybe I should just get used to room temperature water.
