This week I started a second gig with a different client. Little did I know it would lead to a complete rearrangement of my workstation.

I am accustomed to working from home because I've been doing it for many years. I have a work laptop that is plugged into two monitors. I use a wireless mouse and ergonomic keyboard on a tray that hangs below the desk. Everything is ergonomically correct.

This week I received my equipment for the second gig, which consists of a laptop, a docking station, and two monitors. I'm glad they sent the two monitors because working on a laptop for any length of time is uncomfortable and will lead to injury. I have a now-thawed, once-frozen shoulder as proof. I have an L-shaped desk, so I thought the best approach would be to set up the new laptop and monitors on the open portion of my desk. 

Who knew that power outlets would be at a premium! My existing laptop and two monitors take up three slots, and the new laptop and monitors take up the other three slots of the six-outlet power strip. I had to rearrange my wireless base station and a few other items to accommodate the new set up.

Starting Monday, I will be staring at four wide-screen monitors along with my personal MacBook Air. Don't forget the occasional glance at the iPhone and iPad. I'll need to find the special glasses with the yellow lenses to minimize eye strain. 

I told the new client that I'm going to have one hand on each keyboard playing them both like Jerry Lee Lewis. Goodness gracious great balls of fire!
