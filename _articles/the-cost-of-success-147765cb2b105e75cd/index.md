> When you make the decision for success, you don't negotiate the price. Greatness costs what it costs. --Matt Morris, author of The Unemployed Millionaire

I was Valedictorian of my high school graduating class. Granted, my class size was only 114, but I still managed to be at the top. I'm not bringing it up to brag. I was going to pretend to have a friend who was Valedictorian and tell my story and thought why not just tell the truth.

There is a price for success. There is a price to be the best. And it costs what it costs. There is no negotiating once you make the decision that you want to be the best. In the case of being at the top of my class, it was a heck of a lot of work. It was no missed days of school. It was no missing homework assignments. It was lots of reading and writing and paying attention in class.Â 

I have my mother to thank for a lot of my motivation. I'd bring home a report card with all A's and a B and she would ask, "What's with this B?" I'd bring home a report card with all A's and one A- and she would ask, "What's with the A-?" I'd bring home a report card with all A's and three A+'s and she would ask, "Why aren't the other ones A+'s?" My grades were never good enough. This is one reason why I worked relentlessly to be the best.

_It's a long way to the top of you wanna rock 'n' roll. --AC/DC_

Some people want shortcuts to the top. They want to be the best without putting in the work and paying the price to get there. It's not going to happen. It's fine if you want to just be good at whatever you are pursuing. Nobody says you have to be the best. But if you have made the decision to be the best, be prepared to pay the price. No negotiation.
