I'm up to 63 episodes of my podcast [The Brandonian Doctrine](https://anchor.fm/brandon-wilson99). A friend of mine asked me if I am running out of ideas. Absolutely not. I seem to have an endless supply of ideas. The trick is turning a one-line idea into an episode.Â 

I would like to share some of my ideas and ask those who have been listening to the podcast if you want me to move any of these into the production queue. As I have said before, my podcast has an audience of 1--me. But if there are some people out there enjoying it, might as well give the people what they want!

Without further ado (that is the correct phrase, it's not adieu):

*   Knowledge is not power
*   What is an essential employee/business?
*   They'll give anyone a senior title
*   A salesperson's behavior before and after the sale
*   Products labeled as "diabetic friendly"
*   The fabled three-check month
*   Results not typical in ads--why not show me the typical results?
*   Internet of things. Do I want my refrigerator to tell me I'm out of milk?
*   What's this rush to get married during a pandemic?
*   The reward for doing a good job is more work
*   The luxury becomes the necessity
*   A smoothie fails on texture. I either want to drink a beverage or eat a meal but what is this smoothie?
*   Virtual escape rooms--as if regular escape rooms were not bad enough
*   The turkey bacon hypothesis--if I'm going to have bacon I want the real deal
*   A wrap is just an uncool burrito. And don't get me started on no-bake cookies and flourless cake.
*   What is the best way to get out of talking to Mormons?
*   Living in the moment. Where else exactly can you be living?
*   Cyberbullying--I have an easy solution.
*   A pastor's threat--see you on Sunday
*   I'm tired of "articles" that are just lists of tweets
*   What's this dinner theater? Some murder mystery or show. I just want to eat!
*   All this attention on first responders but what about last responders?
*   Grocery shopping - time to take apart the usual advice
*   Just a "friendly reminder" how about unfriendly reminders?
