I'm trying to figure out what makes Mondays so bad. Most people who work Monday-Friday and have the weekends off would be starting back to work on Monday. Is it having the two days off what makes it tough? I worked 12 hours this weekend, and yet Monday is still pretty rough.

If someone works Tuesday through Saturday and has Sunday and Monday off, is Tuesday that person's Monday?

Is it the fact that I expect Monday to be bad, so it is a self-fulfilling prophecy?

I have a headache right now, and I suspect it's probably from eye strain. When you have some time away from the computer and then park in front of four screens for ten hours that's bound to happen.

I can see how people who sleep in on weekends have problems waking up on Monday morning. In terms of my sleep schedule, it is very consistent. There is no deviation between weekdays and weekends. I'm up at the same time and go to sleep at the same time every day. 

I'm tired of looking at screens. I suppose I can write the old-fashioned way on a piece of paper, but that would be much slower and of course, no one would see it. 

At least the bulk of Monday is over.
