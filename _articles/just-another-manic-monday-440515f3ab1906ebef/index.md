No manic Monday for me, thankfully. Folks at my client in California, however, are having all sorts of challenges.

California is experiencing a heatwave with temps over 100 degrees F. Many people in California do not have A/C (or what they refer to as "central air"). So, I'm sure many of them had a rough weekend.

The heat has caused electricity capacity to be maxed out, and so there have been rolling blackouts to meet the demands. It appears that these periods of no electricity are kept short (around two hours). A bigger problem surfaced with a major wind storm over the weekend that knocked out power lines causing people to lose power for much longer. One person on a call today has been without power since 5 PM on Friday. Other folks are without power this morning and were lucky enough that their phones were still working but otherwise, they cannot work.

On top of all this, many kiddies are returning to school this week in the form of online schooling. Some parents who are fortunate to still have power and internet are reporting that they keep getting kicked off the home internet ([INTERNET's DOWN!](https://cowriters.app/words/internet-s-down-431505f18ddde619b3)) because of all the bandwidth taken up by presumably a rush of knowledge and wisdom being transferred to laptops and iPads for children's edification.

I am grateful that I'm not dealing with any of these issues. Let's hope for all those affected that the week finishes in a much better place than the inauspicious beginning.
