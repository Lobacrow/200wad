When I was a kid, one of my favorite gadgets was a tape recorder. I remember starting with reading stories and other content, but I migrated to creating my own content. I used to interview family members. I was creating fake newscasts before those became a real thing. 

Apparently, I had a penchant for coming up with oddball ideas with my strange sense of humor. My older brother Bill coined the term for these musings: The Brandonian Doctrine.

When I got the first iPhone in 2007, one of my favorite apps was the voice recorder. It was so easy to hit play and record snippets and to share them with other people. I've been doing this for many years because it's actually fun for me. I enjoy recording, and I enjoy listening to the recordings because I crack myself up. 

Up until now, I have only shared these clips with a small audience of friends. I send them clips because I think they'll get a kick out of them. Maybe they do, maybe they don't. It doesn't matter as long as I find them funny.

Sometimes I get so caught up in being productive, self-improvement, and trying to get out of The Matrix that I don't do much of anything just for the fun of it. I want to change that.

Today I am launching what I refer to as a micro podcast called [The Brandonian Doctrine.](https://anchor.fm/brandon-wilson99) I think now is as good a time as any to try to add a little humor into the world. Each episode will be very short (between 30 seconds and 1 minute), and I will publish them as the ideas come to me. 

As Tony Robbins says, "Complexity is the enemy of execution." I'm not even using my fancy microphone set-up. I am not doing take after take after take to get the perfect one. I am using my iPhone and the Anchor platform to quickly publish these recordings. 

I'm doing this for the fun of it. If nobody else is listening that's okay because I am.

And I can't stop giggling.
