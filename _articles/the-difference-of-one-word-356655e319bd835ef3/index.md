This morning I overheard a conversation between two people as we all walked into the office.

Person 1: "Gosh, it's only Wednesday."

Person 2: "And I was just thinking it's Wednesday already!"

This isn't just a difference in wording between _only Wednesday_ and _Wednesday already_ but a tremendous difference in mindset.

Each week, I find myself dreading the upcoming week during the weekend, especially on Sundays. After the week is over, I realize that dreading the week was worse than the actual week. You'd think I'd learn my lesson, but then Sunday rolls around and it's back to [Judge Dredd](https://cowriters.app/words/a-lesson-to-stop-dreading-344205e19ea6e56be0).

One solution is obvious: stop doing the thing during the week that I'm dreading. That's called the main job, and I'm working on it. In the meantime, I need to continue to work on my mindset.

I am grateful for another Wednesday. I am grateful for the skills I have and the opportunity to provide value to others. Each day is a new opportunity. Yes, it's cliche, but if I don't constantly remind myself I have a tendency to slide into negativeland.
