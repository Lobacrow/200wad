What follows is my summary of the highlights of a [recent episode of the Health Theory podcast featuring an interview between Tom Bilyeu and Dave Asprey](https://youtu.be/TqqCzyKP4F8), founder of Bulletproof, Inc. I previously [wrote about Dave's latest book _Super Human_](https://200wordsaday.com/words/super-human-288645da1f1da59ce3).Â 

  

According to Dave, when talking about longevity everything boils down to a return on investment. Usually, we think about investing in money or time. But actually we are investing energy. If you have energy, you can use the energy to make money. If you have time but no energy, the time is useless. If you have money but no energy, the money is mostly useless unless you spend it to get your energy back. We humans get our energy from mitochondria, ancient bacteria that exist in our cells and drive our core functions.
