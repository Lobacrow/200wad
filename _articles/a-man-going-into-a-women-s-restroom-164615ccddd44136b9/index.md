At the request of @lucjah and inspired by @philh, I shall share an embarrassing story about how I accidentally walked into a women's restroom.

This event occurred approximately 12-13 years ago while I was working at a health insurance company. I agreed to meet a colleague after work for a couple of beers. I arrived at the bar/restaurant first and ordered a 20 oz beer. He texted me and told me he was running late, no big deal. I finished the first beer and ordered a second one. I was nearly finished with the second beer when my colleague finally showed up. I greeted him and then immediately told him I had to use the restroom due to all that beer. I was also a little buzzed by this time.

Let me pause for a moment to describe something that seems unrelated but will factor into the unfortunate events.

In the department where I worked, there was a door that led to a hallway. To the right was the break room and to the left was a shorter hallway with the restrooms. In the shorter hallway, the first door on the right was the men's room and the door at the end was the women's room. This was the primary restroom near my area, so I had used it countless times without even thinking about it. On a side note, I find this to be an unusual setup because in my experience when you encounter restrooms, the women's restroom is usually first.

Back to the story. At the bar/restaurant I walked to the restroom, which happened to be near the entrance. I turned a corner and there was a short hallway. The first door on the right was the **women's** restroom, and theÂ second door at the end was the **men's** restroom. This is the exact opposite configuration from what I was used to at work. So my excuses are A) I was so used to going into the first door at work that I didn't even think about looking at the sign, and B) I was a little drunk. So I walked right into the women's restroom.

_To be continued..._

Stay tuned tomorrow for the riveting conclusion!
