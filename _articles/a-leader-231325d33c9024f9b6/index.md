Takes extreme ownership

  

Never quits

Competes with themselves

Productive not just busy

Gives up some control

Leans into the pain

> The will to do springs from the knowledge that we can do. Doubt and fear are the great enemies of knowledge, and he who encourages them, who does not slay them, thwarts himself at every step. He who has conquered doubt and fear has conquered failure. --James Allen
