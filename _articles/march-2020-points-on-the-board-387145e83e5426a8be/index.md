What a weird month. I'd say just about everyone's plans got derailed due to the novel coronavirus. Nevertheless, I'm still pushing to put points on the board.

*   Facebook page [Improve Your Sleep](https://www.facebook.com/Getyourzzzs/?view_public_for=112095793657211): For the month of March, I had a total post reach of 42,860, post engagement of 7,036, and added 22 followers for a total of 175 followers. It's the little page that could. I still post some type of content every day. I ran out of steam on the Facebook course, but I'm planning to dive back in and get my money's worth. I am sure there are plenty of concepts I'm missing to get more traction.
*   As I [wrote about previously](https://cowriters.app/words/big-announcement-386465e81342809011), the biggest point on the board is declaring that I have reversed type 2 diabetes. It just happened to land in this month, but I've been working on Project Food as Fuel for a long time. I wrote the longest post (almost 10K words) I've ever written. I'm sure when Medium displays that it's a 40-minute read that it scares many people away. I could have cut out a lot of material, but I wanted this to be the definitive piece of the journey. It's also a trial run for long-form content. If you are curious about my style or how my sleep book will sound, this piece will give you some clues.

I feel like I should have more to share. I hesitate to declare any plans for April. At this point, at least I know I'll be at home for the month. I intend to take full advantage of that.
