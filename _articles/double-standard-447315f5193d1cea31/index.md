I saw a news story about a comedian who was being accused of exposing himself to several women. I try to understand the world from other people's perspectives, but on this one, I just cannot understand what it's like to be a woman. And by the way, I don't expect women to understand what it's like to be a man.

If a woman decides to flash me her boobs or pull up her skirt, I'm not going to file a police report. If she's attractive, I may become aroused. If she's unattractive, I will be disgusted. Either way, I go on with life.Â 

Now, before the #Metoo community comes after me, I'm not condoning any behavior which is not consensual between adults. I do think there are degrees of seriousness. I draw distinctions between saying something, showing something, and doing something. Clearly physical assault, rape, and violence are far worse than someone calling you a name or showing you something you may not want to see.

By the way, on the subject of gender equality, I have an easy solution. I will ask the question, "Are men and women equal?" Just tell me the answer and I'll act accordingly.
