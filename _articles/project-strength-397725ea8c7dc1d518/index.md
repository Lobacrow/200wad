As I wrote about a week ago, [Project Food as Fuel is coming to a close](https://cowriters.app/words/project-food-as-fuel-comes-to-a-close-395485ea0e3154a900). This doesn't mean I will be footloose and fancy-free with my diet. I will maintain a low-carb diet, but I won't be staying in ketosis 100% of the time. I will take a fine-tuning approach rather than the full focus I've had over the last year.

My new doctor and I agreed that my next focus should be strength training. It's time to add muscle to further improve my metabolism, help eliminate excess fat, and become stronger to prevent injuries. I need to undo (or at least mitigate) the damage caused by sitting at a computer for 8-10 hours a day.

I haven't done serious strength training in almost twenty years. I never planned to jump right into working out because I know that is a surefire way to get injured. Since October of 2019, I have been working with a [flex therapist for assistive stretching](https://cowriters.app/words/stretching-my-way-to-physical-activity-302805dbdf07d03bae). This was absolutely the right approach because now I feel more limber and able to take on more taxing physical exercise.

My flex therapist also happens to be a physical trainer, and she's put together a training program for me. I gave her one simple request to keep in mind when designing the program--imagine I've been in a coma for twenty years and I just learned how to walk.

The "Total Body Strengthening Program" targets three primary areas:

1.  Upper body - Using resistance bands and a kettlebell. 
2.  Lower body - Squats and lunges
3.  Core - Kettlebell rotations and planks

Since I won't be traveling for a while, I am going to stage my workout at home. If and when I start traveling again, I will figure out how to take the show on the road.

My first workout is in the books! I purposely waited until after my workout to write about this new project. I believe the technical term for my status is that I'm in "piss-poor shape." My lower body and core are so weak, I'm not sure how I manage to ambulate this 195.5-pound body seemingly without much exertion.

I have a long way to go. I know it's not going to be easy after neglecting my physical fitness for so long. I know I'm going to be sore tomorrow. I'm going to have a protein shake this evening, and I have set myself up for a great night of sleep--both are keys to recovery.
