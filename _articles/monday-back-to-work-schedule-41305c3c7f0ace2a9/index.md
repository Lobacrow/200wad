When I was between assignments I noticed an interesting thing about the days of the week. They tended to all blend together. Weekdays did not seem much different from weekends. Several people who are freelancers or do not have typical jobs commented the same thing. It appears that a traditional job is what drives this feeling.

Today definitely feels like a Monday. I am off to the airport to travel to California for the week to start my next assignment. Many people dread Mondays, but I have been looking forward to this one. The uncertainty of the next assignment created anxiety when normally I would be enjoying the time between gigs.

I usually travel on Sundays, so hopefully traveling today means the week won't seem so long.Â 

I'm going to save time today but practicing my gratitude practice here.

I am grateful to be traveling to the west coast instead of through the midwest to the east coast where all the storms are.

I am grateful that a former client has requested my services once more.

I am grateful that there are still TSA agents showing up despite not being paid due to the government shutdown.

I am grateful to have established daily habits and routines that will make it easier to keep them going on the road.

I am grateful that I have to buy some new clothes because the old ones have become too big.

Happy Monday everyone!
