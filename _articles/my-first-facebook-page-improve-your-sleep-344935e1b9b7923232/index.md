My theme for 2020 is Points on the Board.Â 

One of my primary areas of focus is the topic of sleep. I think it's so important that I'm writing a book about it as you can read in my [Writing a Book collection](https://200wordsaday.com/@brandonwilson/writing-a-book-2365d54aed86d920).

In the meantime, I've decided to start to grow an audience and use Facebook as the platform. My choice was driven in part by a [podcast episode](https://podtail.com/en/podcast/break-through-the-noise-with-jon-morrow/rachel-miller-the-quirky-mom-who-got-3-million-fac/) featuring an interview between Jon Morrow and Rachel Miller. Rachel offers a course on how to grow an audience on Facebook. I signed up for the course Friday night. I have a Facebook profile, but I had never created a page or tried anything remotely business-related on Facebook (okay maybe a little monkey business ?).

The course provided value immediately by walking me through how to create a Facebook page, create some content, and boost the content using Facebook ads. The end result is the page [Improve Your Sleep](https://www.facebook.com/Getyourzzzs/?view_public_for=112095793657211). So far the page has accumulated 17 followers. If you are on Facebook and interested in anything I've written about sleep, this is the page for you. I don't have anything to sell. It's all about providing value and sharing what I have learned from the research I'm doing for my book. I hope to grow an audience of people who find this content valuable.

The irony is last night I was wide awake at 3 AM thinking about content for my page. Even if you have mastered the sleep lion, he still gets out of the cage occasionally.
