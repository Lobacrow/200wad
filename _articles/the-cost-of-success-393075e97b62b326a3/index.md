> When you make the decision for success, you don't negotiate the price. Greatness costs what it costs. --Matt Morris, author of The Unemployed Millionaire

I was Valedictorian of my high school graduating class. Granted, my class size was only 114, but I still managed to be at the top. I'm not bringing it up to brag. I was going to pretend to have a friend who was Valedictorian and tell my story and thought why not just tell the truth.

There is a price for success. There is a price to be the best. And it costs what it costs. There is no negotiating once you make the decision that you want to be the best. In the case of being at the top of my class, it was a heck of a lot of work. It was no missed days of school. It was no missing homework assignments. It was lots of reading and writing and paying attention in class. 

I have my mother to thank for a lot of my motivation. I'd bring home a report card with all A's and a B and she would ask, "What's with this B?" I'd bring home a report card with all A's and one A- and she would ask, "What's with the A-?" I'd bring home a report card with all A's and three A+'s and she would ask, "Why aren't the other ones A+'s?" My grades were never good enough. This is one reason why I worked relentlessly to be the best.

Some people want shortcuts to the top. They want to be the best without putting in the work and paying the price to get there. It's not going to happen. It's fine if you want to just be good at whatever you are pursuing. Nobody says you have to be the best. But if you have made the decision to be the best, be prepared to pay the price. No negotiation.

It's tax day in the US, and I think this post from last year was coincidentally on the topic of cost. 

Plenty of people say they want to be the best at something. Are they willing to do what it takes to be the best? Am I? Are you?

Look at athletes who compete in the Olympics. This year the Olympic games are postponed, which could be devastating for the athletes who have been training for years. The physical and mental training must be exhausting. 

US Olympian Simone Biles recently posted a [video of her completing the "handstand challenge."](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/12/us/simone-biles-handstand-challenge-trnd/index.html) This challenge involves doing a handstand without any support and remaining in that position without falling while removing your pants using only your feet and legs. I am in awe that human beings are able to do this. I would be able to do less than a tenth of one percent of that physical activity. As soon as I tried performing a handstand, I would probably immediately fall and break my neck. 

I'm not sure I want to be the best at anything. It's a choice not to be made lightly.
