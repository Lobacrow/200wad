I was primed to write about this next movie after watching Quentin Tarantino's latest offering _Once Upon A Time In Hollywood_. Some people might quibble with this statement, but I maintain that Tarantino's best film is _Pulp Fiction_.

_Pulp Fiction_ is not a single story but several stories interwoven with various character interactions. Tarantino's signature dialogue is on full display carried out by incredible performances from noted actors including Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta (in his comeback role), Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, and Christopher Walken among others. 

Of course there is violence and gore. But perhaps the mastery on display here is found in the mundane events and dialogue between the characters.

Here is one of my favorite exchanges. 

Vincent: You know what they call a, uh, a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?

Jules: They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?

Vincent: Nah, man, they got the metric system, they wouldn't know what the f@#! a Quarter Pounder is. 

Jules: What do they call it?

Vincent: They call it a Royale with Cheese.

Jules: Royale with Cheese.

Vincent: That's right.

Jules: What do they call a Big Mac?

Vincent: A Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac. 

Jules: Le Big Mac \*laughs\* What do they call a Whopper?

Vincent: I dunno. I didn't go into Burger King.

If you haven't seen _Pulp Fiction_ and are not offended by course language, violence, and drug references, I would recommend a viewing.
