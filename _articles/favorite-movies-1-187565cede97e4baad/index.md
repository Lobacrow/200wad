There are certain movies that any time I flipped channels, (when I had cable/satellite tv) I would stop and watch them if they were on. I can watch them over and over again and never get tired of them. I decided to finally put together a collection of my favorite movies in no particular order. 

_**The Shawshank Redemption**_ 

This movie is based on the Stephen King novella _Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption_. It's not your typical horror movie, although the depictions of life in prison are pretty horrible. 

This movie was released in 1994 while I was still in high school. It received positive reviews but was not a big box office hit. It earned only $16 million in the initial theatrical run. The movie did catch fire in the rental market and was one of the top movie rentals of 1995. 

There is so much to like about this movie. It's a great story. There are great characters and great acting. And of course, when you have narration by Morgan Freeman you really can't go wrong. The movie stayed true to the Stephen King story, which is why it has stood the test of time for me.

If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor and carve out a chunk of time (it's over 2 hours) to watch it. It is a story about redemption and hope, two things we need more of nowadays.
