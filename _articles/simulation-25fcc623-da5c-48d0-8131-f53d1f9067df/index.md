Just when you thought things couldn't get any crazier, the first thing I read this morning is that President Trump and First Lady Melania both tested positive for coronavirus. 

Maybe Elon Musk was onto something when he suggested that we are living in a simulation. If so, I think someone spilled Coke Zero all over the controls for Year 2020.

I continue to struggle with walking the fine line between wanting to be informed about important events and issues and getting inundated with noise that is not really news. This is especially true in an election year. 

You would think science would be one area where the facts outweigh opinions and spin. The problem is the novel coronavirus is still too new for us to really understand how bad it is. Deaths are only one way of tracking severity. We don't know the long term effects for people who tested positive for the virus regardless of how severe their symptoms were.

I keep reading stories with phrases such as "in these uncertain times..." First of all, when have the times been certain? We have always been living in uncertain times. Anyone who thinks otherwise has a false sense of security and stability. 

How do we cope with all this? I refer to my daily reminder.
