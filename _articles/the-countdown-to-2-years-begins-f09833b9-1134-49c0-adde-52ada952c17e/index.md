It's been confirmed that Writelier formerly Co-Writers formerly 200wordsaday will cease operation at the end of the year.

I've been here every day since December 5, 2018. 

You know what, it's a little tough to write this post. I suppose I have to admit to some emotional attachment to this little corner of the internet. 

I am grateful that a tool came along at the right time that provided the least amount of friction to write and post online every day. I am grateful that there was a streak mechanism that seemed tailor-made for me that helped me establish the habit. All the thanks go to @basilesamel.

I am grateful that in this community, I found people who wanted to do the same thing. These are people all over the world who speak different languages, have different jobs and lives, but all found a common bond showing up every day and keeping tabs on each other. 

Writing can be a lonely endeavor, and maybe that's why many people give up on the craft. 

It's time to announce the [#Countdownto2years.](#Countdownto2years.) I have decided that a full two years will give me a clean break. Less than a month to go, and December 5, 2020 will be my last post here.

Without question, I will keep writing every day. It's a part of me now. I have transformed part of my identity into a writer, and writers write every day. If I find an online platform with a community of writers, I'll post online. If not, I'll write privately. 

What will happen after that? I don't know except to quote Bono:

> I have to go away...and dream it all up again.

The [#Countdownto2years](#Countdownto2years) begins.
