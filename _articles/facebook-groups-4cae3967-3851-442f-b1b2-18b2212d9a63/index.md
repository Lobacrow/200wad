I have a love/hate relationship with Facebook Groups. As with anything, the success and value of the group depends on the members. 

Some of my interests overlap multiple groups, and I have been interacting in them more recently. It is interesting to note how the groups operate. I'm in a biohacking group where it's pretty much wide open with free sharing of information. That one is probably my favorite. I'm in other groups that are more locked down in terms of what you can and cannot share. There's one group that does not allow any external links, and I found that out when my post to my newsletter about sleep was taken down. Apparently one person's answer to "google it" is just fine, but when I try to provide value it's taken down. 

The admins can do whatever they want. It's their group. But I don't have to stay in the group, and indeed I can choose to start my own group. I'm not ready for that right now, but it's certainly an option to consider in the future. 

I get very annoyed by gatekeepers who control what information people have access to, especially when the information is on topics that are important yet somehow associated with controversy (health topics).
