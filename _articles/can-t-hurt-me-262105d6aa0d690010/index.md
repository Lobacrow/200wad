**Challenge #1 Identify your limiting factors. (end of Chapter 4)**

What bad cards have you been dealt with in life? What challenges did you encounter as a child? Abuse, bullying, insecurity? Maybe your grew up so supported and comfortable that you never pushed yourself. What are the challenges you face right now? How are they related to challenges you experienced in the past? Write out in detail the pain you have experienced. List the reasons why you think you are not achieving all that you could be. Call them reasons. Call them excuses. Take inventory and get detailed about it in a journal. When you have a "whoa is me" mentality it shapes how you react. You have to find power in the misery and the bad things that have happened to you.
