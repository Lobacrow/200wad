[As I wrote about previously](https://cowriters.app/words/project-food-as-fuel-what-s-next-425675f050ddc3bd9e), I am crafting what will be my long-term diet using a variety of sources.

The Bulletproof Diet was developed by Dave Asprey who is referred to as the Father of Biohacking. I learned about the Bulletproof Diet by experimenting with one key element of the diet: Bulletproof coffee. For those who are unfamiliar, Bulletproof coffee involves blending ghee (clarified butter) and MCT oil into the coffee. Years ago I started drinking Bulletproof coffee, and without making any other changes I started to lose weight, have more energy, and be more mentally focused.

At its core, the Bulletproof Diet is a high-fat, moderate protein, low carb diet. It involves carb cycling so that one does not remain in ketosis.
