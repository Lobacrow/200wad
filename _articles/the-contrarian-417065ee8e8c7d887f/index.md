Ever since I can remember, I have been a contrarian.

> contrarian - a person who takes a contrary position or attitude

My brain is hard-wired to go against conventional thinking. 

For example, I saw @basilesamel 's recent piece about ways to reduce a website's carbon footprint, and my mind went immediately to writing a piece about how to increase a website's carbon footprint. I don't have a vested interest in this topic. I just like being a contrarian (or that's how my brain works and I enjoy familiarity).

Similarly, I saw @arthurkendall start a piece with 10 tips for actually enjoying work from home. I suppose this would be instead of pretending to enjoy work from home? I immediately thought of an article with 10 tips to make work at home the least pleasant as possible. 

I bet @efran understands this because I think he has contrarian tendencies also as evidenced by his ebook with how to fail at a blog.

I have started parlaying my automatic contrarian thinking into content in the form of my [podcast](https://anchor.fm/brandon-wilson99), which I describe as "musings from a contrarian mind." But I'm just doing that for fun. I need to figure out how to take this natural tendency and use it to my advantage.
