The word _inflammation_ comes from the Latin _inflammare_, meaning "to set on fire." Inflammation is the body's natural way of coping with an injury or foreign invader. In a healthy person, the immune response is swift, meets the challenge, and then subsides. In some people, though, the immune response gets stuck in "high" mode. This is called chronic inflammation and it's bad for the entire body including the brain.

There are several risk factors for inflammation:

*   High C-reactive protein (blood test). A healthy range is between 0.0 and 1.0 mg/L
*   High homocysteine (blood test). A healthy level is less than 8 micromoles/liter.
*   Low levels of vitamin D (blood test). Vitamin D deficiency is defined as less than 20 ng/mL.
*   Low Omega-3 Index (blood test). A healthy Omega-3 Index level is above 8 percent.
*   Environment toxins
*   Smoking
*   Excessive alcohol
*   Chronic stress
*   Childhood trauma
*   Gum disease
*   Obesity, especially belly fat
*   Prediabetes or diabetes
*   Insomnia, especially in shift workers
*   Excessive exercise (thankfully no worries on this one for me!)
*   Proinflammatory foods such as sugar, high-glycemic, low-fiber foods that quickly turn into sugar, trans fats, excessive omega-6 fatty acids from corn, soy, and vegetable oils, artificial sweeteners, and gluten.
*   Leaky gut and/or unhealthy microbiome

The gut (gastrointestinal tract) is often referred to as the second brain because it is lined with about 100 million neurons. The gut lining is only a single cell layer thick. Anything that causes the cell junctions to widen or become porous allows toxins into your body that can cause inflammation.

You have good bacteria and bad bacteria in your gut. A healthy ratio is about 85% good bacteria and 15% bad bacteria. When that ratio shifts toward too much bad bacteria, it can cause a host of health problems. 

**My Action Steps**

*   I need to get fresh lab tests for CRP, homocysteine, and Vitamin D. My last results from August were the following:

CRP: 2.73 (still a little higher than I'd like)

Vitamin D: 39.6 (not worried, I'm in sunny AZ after all)

Homocysteine: 11.8 (not worried)

I have not taken an Omega-3 Index test, so I'm adding that one to the list.

*   Brush AND floss teeth at least twice per day.
*   Consume prebiotics in the form of dietary fiber and probiotics in the form of fermented foods or supplements.
*   Take a B-complex supplement.
*   Take a curcumin supplement.
*   Limit or eliminate omega-6 rich foods such as corn, soy, refined oils, and processed foods.
*   Include omega-3 rich foods in my diet including fish, avocados, and seeds and tree nuts. When I'm unable to get enough omega-3 through diet, I will take a high-quality fish oil supplement.
*   Choose organic foods that are hormone- and antibiotic-free. Beef should be grass-fed and grass-finished. 
*   Meditate for at least ten minutes every day.
