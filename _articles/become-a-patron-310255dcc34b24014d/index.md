Back in the '90s when the internet was becoming mainstream there was something called shareware. Shareware was software primarily created by independent developers who gave it away for free. In some cases, the developers released full versions of the applications and simply relied on donations. In other cases, they released demos or limited the functionality to a specific trial period. Today's analog is "freemium" apps that you can download for free with in-app purchases.

I used a shareware internet relay chat (IRC) client for many years. It allowed full use of the application for thirty days, then it expired and required you to pay one price (as I recall it was $15) to continue using it. I figured out that there was a file in my preferences folder that I could delete, which effectively made the application think it was just installed. I had to adjust my windows and settings, but it was worth it for another thirty days. Then another thirty days, rinse and repeat.

I was a starving college student. I felt I didn't need to pay for something if I could get it for free. I had no concept that most shareware apps and games were created by independent developers scraping by trying to make a living. I was also a stingy tipper. I also had no concept that service workers do not get paid very much and rely heavily on tips.

Today I have a different perspective. I tip well for services and reward good service handsomely. I also believe in paying for something when I receive the benefit.

_Aside_ - In college, my roommate was dragged by his mother to a [Benny Hinn](https://www.bennyhinn.org/) event at an arena (not to be confused with [Benny Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Hill), who would have offered quite a different show). My roommate mentioned that at one point they were passing out Kentucky Fried Chicken buckets. He couldn't wait to get a piece of extra crispy chicken until he realized the buckets were for collecting the offering.

_Second Aside_ - Someone once told me the two best places to get rid of counterfeit money are a stripper's g-string and an offering plate at church. I'm not sure how successful one would be at a gentleman's club considering the effect of black lights on fake money. As far as the offering plate, that one is between you and your chosen deity.

At some point, MacOS upgraded to a version that was no longer supported by that IRC client. Even though I could no longer use the application, I sent a check for $100 to the developer with a short note thanking him for his work.Â 

I can't remember when I became a patron at 200WAD, but it was when I realized that I had been using the site every day and it was providing value to me. I didn't sign up to get the extra features, although I have used them on occasion. I signed up because I believe in @basilesamel and I want to support what he's doing.

If you are just starting out on 200WAD, I get it. Take your time. Kick the tires. See if you plan to be here for the long haul. For people who have been here a while who are not patrons, it's time to step it up. It's $5/month. Are you really going to tell me that you don't waste at least $5/month on something? Think of it as investing in yourself. You benefit because you have skin in the game. Baz benefits because he gets closer to ramen profitability (we really need a keto-friendly term for that.)

By the way, Baz did not ask me to write this post. This is what the muse wanted me to put forth today, and I'm happy to do it.
