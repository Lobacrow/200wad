N is for Neurohormone Issues

Hormones are chemical messengers produced in the body that control and regulate the activity of certain cells or organs. Neurohormones have an important impact on the brain. When they are out of balance, you feel older, may experience symptoms similar to brain health/mental health conditions like anxiety, depression, and even psychosis.

7 Neurohormones that influence brain health/mental health

1.  **Thyroid** - regulates energy and mood
2.  **Cortisol** - helps to manage stress and anxiety
3.  **DHEA** - fights stress and depression; decreases brain inflammation
4.  and 5. **Estrogen** and P**rogesterone** - when balanced, promote stable moods

 6. **Testosterone** - affects mood, motivation, sexuality, and strength

 7. **Insulin** - balances blood sugar

The thyroid is a small gland located in the lower neck. It produces three main hormones: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), T3, and T4. These hormones are among the most influential in your body, regulating how it uses energy. The thyroid also has a strong impact on the brain because it controls the production of many neurotransmitters.

The thyroid may become underactive (hypothyroidism) or overactive (hyperthyroidism).

Symptoms of an underactive thyroid:

*   Fatigue
*   Difficulty concentrating
*   Memory problems
*   Depression
*   Attentional problems
*   Psychosis

Symptoms of an overactive thyroid:

*   Sleeplessness; restlessness
*   Anxiety
*   Irritability
*   Racing thoughts
*   Difficulty concentrating
*   Memory problems
*   Depression
*   Mania
*   Psychosis

What causes thyroid disorders? There are autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto's disease or Graves' disease, which may be caused by leaky gut syndrome, a build-up of environmental toxins within the body, or food allergies (particularly gluten and dairy). 

The adrenal glands, located above your kidneys, play a vital role in how your body reacts to stress. When acute stress hits, the adrenals release hormones such as adrenaline, DHEA, and cortisol as part of the "fight or flight" response. This is a natural response that is supposed to be a momentary spike. Unfortunately, constant exposure to stress could lead to consistently high levels of these hormones, which could lead to adrenal fatigue. 

Common signs of adrenal fatigue:

*   Decreased ability to withstand stress
*   Morning and afternoon fatigue, lack of stamina
*   High blood pressure and rapid heartbeat
*   Abdominal fat that doesn't go away no matter what you do
*   Mental fog with poor memory and difficulty concentrating
*   Low sex drive
*   Cravings for sweets or salty foods
*   Dizziness when getting up from a seated or prone position
*   Signs of premature aging
*   Lowered resistance to infection
*   Poor wound healing

Estrogen and progesterone are the primary hormones involved in a woman's menstrual cycle. Progesterone is referred to as the "relaxation hormone." When it is in balance with estrogen, it calms you, brings feelings of peacefulness, and promotes sleep. 

Testosterone is a vital hormone for men that is responsible for the deep voice, facial hair, and many other characteristics. Women produce and need testosterone too, just in smaller amounts. In both men and women, testosterone helps protect the nervous system and wards off depression, cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. It also seems to protect cells from inflammation, which is why some researchers believe that men are less susceptible than women to inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and asthma, and even why men suffer less from depression.

Common symptoms of low testosterone:

*   Moodiness
*   Depression
*   Anxiety
*   Difficulty concentrating
*   Lack of motivation
*   Low libido
*   Fatigue
*   Trouble sleeping
*   Erection problems
*   Increased body fat and reduced lean muscle
*   Low bone density
*   Hot flashes
*   Hair loss

**My Action Steps:**

*   Get regular bloodwork (hormone testing every 6 months)
*   Continue to get regular exercise including lifting weights to build lean muscle mass
*   Continue to prioritize sleep
*   Control stress
*   Avoid hormone disruptors such as BPAs, phthalates, parabens, and pesticides
*   Avoid animal products raised with hormones or antibiotics
*   Get enough fiber to help flush out unhealthy forms of estrogen
*   Identify the right supplements to support healthy hormones
