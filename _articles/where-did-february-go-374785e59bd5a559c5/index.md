It is the last day of the month, and I have already heard three different people say a variation of "Where did the month go? It feels like we just started February!"

I will tell you where February went. February went where you took it. And if you didn't take it anywhere, then you are probably still at where you were back on February 1st. Or worse yet, you somehow fell backward.

The end of the month is as good a time as any to assess your life. I'm not talking about comparing yourself to other people. Stay off social media for this assessment. I want you to compare yourself to the person you were 28 days ago. 

*   Are you healthier?
*   Are you happier?
*   Are you more fulfilled?
*   Are you the same?
*   Are you worse

If you didn't stop and assess yourself at the end of January then maybe you don't even know what to compare yourself to. Let that be a lesson for you. The first step is to assess where you are today. Measure the things that can be measured and note them. Start small and pick one or two areas of your life to focus on. Health is always a good one because if your health is dogging it, that makes it much more difficult to improve all the other areas of your life.

By the way, you don't have to wait for an entire month to go by to do this exercise. You can do it weekly or even daily.

If you don't have goals, it's time to get some. If you aren't working on establishing good habits, get started.

The good news is that February is the shortest month of the year, so if there were a month to slack off this was the one. Tick tock you have ten more months left in 2019.

At the end of March, someone is going to ask you where March went. 

What will be your answer?

It's funny to see this from one year ago. I don't really do these monthly pep talks anymore. Maybe I should. Technically tomorrow is the end of February this year, but I am saving that post for my monthly #Pointsontheboard recap.

I've been thinking about motivation based on how Tony Robbins describes it.

> There are 2 different kinds of motivation: Push requires willpower, and willpower never lasts. What will last is pull – having something so exciting, so attractive, something you desire so much that you have a hard time going to sleep at night, you get up so early in the morning and take it to the next level. That’s what you’re looking to get. --Tony Robbins

Wow, I just took a detour reading all sorts of fantastic quotes from Tony Robbins. If you want to take a look, [check them out](http://famousquotefrom.com/anthony-robbins/). If you do, tell me which ones grab you. If none grab you, check your pulse. 

With writing, I am definitely being pulled. I don't use a calendar or habit tracker or anything to remember to write every day. It just happens. Somedays I may be a little more juiced to plop down in front of ye olde laptop, but once I'm here I get the job done and I enjoy it.

There are other endeavors of mine that require push for a variety of reasons. I'm still plodding through my nutrition course, but when I am short on time that one usually falls by the wayside. The subject matter can be pretty dense at times, and I know it's a means to an end. It can't all be fun. Well, maybe one day but that day is not today.
