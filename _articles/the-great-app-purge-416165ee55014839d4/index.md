It's time to delete some apps from my phone. I suppose I should eventually delete some accounts, but for now, just deleting the apps is the first step so that I'm not as distracted.

**Twitter** - I'm not a huge Twitter user anyway. Other than distributing my daily podcast to my few followers, I don't do much on here.

**LinkedIn** - The last refuge of the unemployed. When I look for my next job, it definitely won't be on LinkedIn.

**Instagram** - I don't post much and bored of whatever I see on my feed. Plus, enough of the link in the bio.

**Reddit** \- I don't think I ever actually used the app. I know some people swear by this site, but I never really understood it.Â 

**Pinterest** - Again, barely use it.

What stays?

**Anchor** - Not for consumption but for my podcast.

**Facebook** - Facebook's days are numbered, but it managed to survive this round.

**Tik Tok** - Enough silly videos to keep me entertained, but I keep it on my last page of apps so it's not readily available.

**Overcast** - My go-to app for podcasts.

**Audible** - I still have my membership and currently listening to the biography of Ben Franklin.

**YouTube** - Videos usually play better in the dedicated app.
