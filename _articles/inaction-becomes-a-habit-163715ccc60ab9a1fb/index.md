People have shared many great tips and advice for how to establish new habits. It could be writing habits or work habits to be more productive or health habits to be healthier. The tips and advice generally focus on actions. Perform actions every day as part of a routine to establish habits. There is a dark side to habits, however, where habits can be tied to inaction.

World-renowned bar and nightlife expert Jon Taffer has explained how he hires people. Bars are a cash business, so it is particularly important to hire trustworthy people who are not going to steal. He said you can ask certain questions in the interview, give personality tests, but there is one indicator that is the greatest predictor of whether a potential hire would steal from him. The single best indicator of whether someone will steal is how they behaved in the previous jobs. If someone stole from his employer in the previous job or a job before that one, there is a high likelihood he will steal again. 

Once a stealer, always a stealer. Once a cheater, always a cheater. Once a quitter, always a quitter. This may sound harsh in that it's writing people off after bad behavior with the assumption that they cannot change. People can change but many don't. They have established habits that are difficult to break. Stealing, cheating, quitting are actions that are easy to see. What's more difficult to see are all the things we are NOT doing that are also deeply-ingrained habits. 

**Inaction becomes a habit.**

How many books have I bought that sit on my bookshelf never opened? Too many to count I'm embarrassed to say. I get fired up to read a book and buy it, and then I get distracted or get fired up about another book. It happens once. It happens again. The more times it happens the easier it is to let it happen. Next thing I know I have a bookshelf full of books that I claimed to want to read but never did. 

Inaction becomes a habit.

How many online courses have I bought and never even started? Or maybe I watched one or two lessons and stopped. I'm guilty of that one too. It's one thing to do this with free courses, but it's a complete waste for courses I paid for.

Inaction becomes a habit.

"I just don't feel like working out today." Welcome to every day of my life! Guilty as charged on this one. Throw one of my unread books (probably on a health topic) at me. But one day becomes the next day becomes a week and a month and you end up morbidly obese with health issues. 

Inaction becomes a habit.

Just as taking action to establish good habits is important, so too is breaking the bad habits of inaction. These are harder to see but if you look hard enough you will find them. 

What are the things you are NOT doing that you know you SHOULD be doing? How long have you been NOT doing them? Have your inactions become habits? That's fine. Forget the past. Each day is a new day. Now you can't say you've never heard of this concept. Knowledge is not power. It's what you do with the knowledge that makes all the difference. So what are you going to do?
