A story is told of the great nineteenth-century violinist Niccola Paganini. He was performing with a full orchestra in front of a sold-out crowd. As the final piece began, suddenly one of the strings on his violin snapped. Without missing a beat, Paganini continued to play with three strings. Within moments another string snapped. Once again, Paganini continued to play flawlessly this time with two strings. Unbelievably, a third string snapped. His determination and ability allowed Paganini to continue playing with only one string left. p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 11.0px 'Helvetica Neue'; color: #000000} span.s1 {font-kerning: none}

  

Once the performance was finished, the audience erupted into an enthusiastic ovation. Paganini raised his violin and shouted out, "Paganini and one string!" He then led the orchestra through an encore while continuing to play his violin with one string. It was a note-for-note rendition.

In 1982 at the World Series of Poker Main Event, a player named Jack Strauss thought he had busted out of the tournament after pushing in all his chips. He lost the hand but discovered one single $500 poker chip hiding under a cocktail napkin. He continued playing with only a "chip and a chair" and won the tournament with a then-record $520,000 prize.

It doesn't matter whether you are down to one string or down to one chip. As long as you are still alive and breathing, you are still in the game.

Life can be difficult especially when you are striving to do something great, to be someone great.

We grow the most when things are the most challenging.

Today is not happening to you. It's happing for you.

The same thing that brings a curse brings a blessing.

You are still in the game.

Never quit.
