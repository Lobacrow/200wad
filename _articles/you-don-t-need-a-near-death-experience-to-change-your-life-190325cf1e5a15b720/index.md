I heard about a [TED talk by Ric Elias](https://www.ted.com/talks/ric_elias?language=en), a passenger who literally had a front-row seat on Flight 1549, the plan that crash-landed in the Hudson River in New York in January 2009. The video is less than five minutes and worth watching.

I would imagine everyone on that plane thought he or she was going to die.
