Yesterday I took a nap for the first time in a long time. I had an uncharacteristic lack of energy and just felt off. The trend continues today.

I suspect one cause is that working out regularly has finally caught up to me. Unfortunately, I'm in the group of people who get sore 2 days after working out. This does not work well with a Tues, Thurs, Sat workout schedule. I need to make some adjustments so that my regimen is sustainable.

I suspect another cause is work. I have two clients, and in the last few weeks I've been billing 55-60 hours per week. This pace can lead to burnout, but my take on burnout is different. Whereas most people are searching for a vacation or time off, I'm leaning into it and driving harder. For the most part, my method works. There are occasions, however, when I need to take my foot off the gas a little.

I was planning to work on the holiday tomorrow because it's a lot easier to get things done when no one else is working. I decided I'm going to take the day off instead. I know when I need to listen to my body and mind, and based on how I felt yesterday and feel today, it's time for a bit of a break.
