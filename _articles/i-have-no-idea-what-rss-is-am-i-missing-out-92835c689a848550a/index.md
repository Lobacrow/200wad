I'm not a mechanic. I know how to operate a vehicle and get from one place to another. I just need the car to work. If I can get by without ever opening the hood, I'm happy.

Similarly, I'm a Mac guy. I have no interest in tweaking code or customizing outside of MacOS or iOS. I don't want to use Terminal or some sort of command line interface. I just want my Mac and iPhone and iPad to work and be easy to use.

This post is aimed at the people opposite of me. The people who like to get under the hood and tinker with the code. In particular, the people that know what RSS is.  

Every now and then I will hear or read a reference to RSS. It's usually an RSS reader or an RSS feed. I have no idea what it is and have not spent the time to learn about it.Â 

What exactly is RSS, and should I care about it? Maybe I'm using it without even knowing it?

If someone can give me a convincing argument for why I should learn about it and use it, I'm all eyes/ears. Otherwise, I am happy to continue operating in ignorance of this particular technology.
