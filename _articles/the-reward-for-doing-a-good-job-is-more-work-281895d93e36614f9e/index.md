I have written enough posts on 200WAD that I have forgotten whether I have covered certain topics. I was surprised that this one is uncharted territory.

When you are working on a team, you quickly realize the people who get things done (and get them done right) and the people who aren't as fast/good/accurate. When you become a manager, you have that much more visibility to what's going on.

Today I had to actually notify a consultant that the client pointed out he's spending too much time on his phone. You can figure out which category from above where he fits.

As a manager, I have to rely on people to get the job done. I am naturally going to give more work to the people who are faster and more accurate and less work to the people who dog it. This is what I refer to as "the reward for doing a good job is more work."

For the IT work we are doing, we need clear and accurate documentation for the business requirements. Usually, business analysts are responsible for translating the gray business requirements into black and white rules that can be configured in the system. Some people just do not have a knack for doing this. I do.Â 

So, even though I have many other responsibilities as the manager of the configuration team, I need to also work on defining business requirements and creating clear documentation.

The reward for doing a good job is more work.
