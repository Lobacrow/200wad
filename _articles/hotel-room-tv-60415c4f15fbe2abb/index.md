I’m in hotel rooms a lot. I was trying to remember the last time I turned on the TV in a hotel room. It was the day of the funeral for George H.W. Bush December 5, 2018. My client was closed that day, so I worked from the hotel and watched the historic event. Prior to that, I cannot remember the last time I turned the TV on in a hotel room.

For one, I cannot stand watching live TV. There are so many commercials, and it takes up too much time. At home I record the shows I want to watch on a DVR and watch them when I want to and skip all the commercials. 

Another reason is that TV is really just noise. Many people have TV on in the background while they are doing something else. This is distracting and will make you less productive at whatever else you are doing.

Some people might say that I'm just substituting one screen for another. Instead of the TV it's a computer screen or an iPad. The difference is that TV is passive viewing. I can use my MacBook or iPad to consume or create content and be productive. 

At home the TV went out of my bedroom a long time ago. I don't miss it. It would be a radical step to get rid of the only TV in the living room, but perhaps I will make strides toward that by finally cutting the cord (dish) and saving time and money.
