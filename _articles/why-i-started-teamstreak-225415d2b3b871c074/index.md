My dad was an engineer and technical writer. He had a master's degree in Latin and Greek from Northwestern. He was a master of English and writing. I would ask him a simple question in an email and receive a reply that could have been published in a magazine as-is. I knew he wrote it on the spot because I had seen him do it. Some people speak in prose, no umms and ahhs, no superfluous words. They speak as if they are reading something prepared in advance. My dad wrote that way.

  

I'm lucky enough to have inherited some of that writing ability. I view it as a gift and a responsibility. I know I have not used this skill to its true potential.

  

I need to become a better writer. 

I'm in an industry and career that is hard for me to be passionate about. Let's face it, most people have a negative opinion of health insurance (unless it was there when you needed it, but that's becoming more and more rare.) 

I have been trapped in the Matrix and only recently discovered that the Matrix even exists. My success in the traditional secondary and post-secondary education system and in traditional office work environments has only served as a disadvantage. By some measures, long-term employment with more than fair compensation should be viewed as success. The problem for me is lack of fulfillment. I know that the key for me to exit the Matrix is to learn new skills but also double-down on my strengths. 

I need to become a better writer.

I was dabbling for awhile. I joined the site Serious Bloggers Only. I bought Jon Morrow's course called Freedom Machine to learn about blogging. I published my first "official" [article](https://medium.com/the-ascent/its-okay-to-be-selfish-sometimes-73152581408a) on Medium on May 5, 2017. It wasn't very good. But it was a start. In the beginning I was enthusiastic, publishing one article a month, and then things dropped off as they tend to do. I needed to find my voice. @mikebyrnes often wrote about finding his writing voice. It's too bad he hasn't been around to share more of his journey.

I need to become a better writer. 

At the end of 2018 I was already planning a "New Year's Resolution" to start writing consistently. To become a better writer you primarily need to do two things: 1) Read a lot, and 2) Write a lot. 

Then I found 200 Words a Day. I don't even remember how I found it. The important thing is that I found it. On December 5, 2018 I started my writing journey on 200WAD. I'll be honest, without the streak component I would not have lasted as long as I have. I can just look at my history to see the evidence. 

So why did I start #Teamstreak? 

I need to become a better writer.

And I placed a bet that there might be some other people who found 200WAD and have the same goal. 

I realize now that there is a fundamental flaw in the creation. Up to this point, #Teamstreak has been a voluntary exit but an involuntary entrance. Reach 30 days of consecutive writing and POOF! you're on #Teamstreak. When I wrote the previous #Teamstreak post, I put the spotlight on people "whether they wanted to be on the team or not." I cast the net out wide when I should have drawn it in close.

My method for becoming a better writer is not for most people. I am sure there are writers on 200WAD who have posted consecutively for 30 days or more who may not have the same goals or may not want to be tied to the idea of #Teamstreak and that is completely fine by me. I want #Teamstreak to be self-selecting.

How do you know whether #Teamstreak is right for you?

*   You need to become a better writer. Notice I did not say "want." Want is for dabblers. Need is for the truly dedicated.
*   You recognize that a fundamental method of improving your writing is to write AND publish every day, no exceptions.
*   You are willing to stay on #Teamstreak until you achieve your desired goals.
*   You enjoy the community of other members of #Teamstreak, relying on the camaraderie, giving support, and supporting others. 

Existing #Teamstreak members, you now have a choice. If what I say resonates with you and you're still in, please tell me. If you are currently in #Teamstreak and don't wish to be formally part of this movement, I want to hear from you as well. I just want a decision and absolutely no hard feelings. If you opt out of #Teamstreak, I won't be tagging you in announcements or bugging you anymore.

What are the benefits of being in #Teamstreak? Let me answer @brianball who will surely ask. Admittedly there isn' t much currently. We have a small spotlight. We have a dedicated Slack channel. But I'm planning some really good things. Think of a Mastermind about writing and overall enhancing mind and body health. 

@basilesamel will need to modify the #Teamstreak page to display only the people who have opted in. 

Going forward, when people reach 30 days of consecutive writing on 200WAD I will reach out to them with the choice to join #Teamstreak. 

It's a humble beginning, but I'm not giving up on my mission. This site came at the right time for me. @keni eloquently explained the benefits she's experienced in her recent [post](https://200wordsaday.com/words/re-we-need-a-200wad-world-summit-224955d2a03482980d). We are just getting started.

My father was the only person I knew who could type faster than I can with complete accuracy. At some point near the end of his life, his mental and physical abilities deteriorated. His hands tightened up to the point where he could only type with his two index fingers.  His emails had various mistakes. It was like a different person had written them. His gift was locked away, never to return. I will not keep my gift locked away. It's time to unlock it. It's time to improve myself so that I can help others improve themselves.

I need to become a better writer.

Each day. Every day. 

Will you join me?
