In case you missed it, here is [Part 1](https://200wordsaday.com/words/hotel-showers-120775c87c4be37acd) of my dissertation on hotel showers. Since I am traveling this week, I have more to say on this topic. Heads up @amie!

I have encountered several interesting billboards while driving across the country. There are a surprising number of advertisement for casinos. There are also advertisements for goods such as "Over 5,000 boots!" and the "Largest Selection of Indian Jewelry." There have also been multiple billboards advertising "Clean restrooms."Â 

Clean restrooms sound appealing. But shouldn't that be the offering anyway? Now that establishment is on the hook to always have clean restrooms lest they suffer the wrath of some road-weary traveler looking for a clean oasis after hours of travel. But I digress.

Last night I stayed at a Springhill Suites Marriott property. I have not stayed at this particular chain before, but I'm using points for this stay and it is conveniently-located. This hotel will always be remembered for its terrible shower design.

It is a shower only without a tub. The shower head is on the left with the control below it. There is a glass wall divided in half by the shower door. The kicker is that the shower door opens on the right side. This design completely disrupts my usual strategy for temperature control. While standing outside the shower, I like to reach in and turn on the water to let it reach the right temperature. In this shower, it is impossible to stand outside the shower and reach in to turn it on without immediately getting blasted with ice cold water. My best solution was to undress, stand below and to the side of the shower head, and turn on the water while cowering in the corner until determining the appropriate temperature. This is not a great way to start the morning.

Yes, this is a first world problem. It's been a great trip so far. I'll stop complaining now and shift back to a grateful mindset.
