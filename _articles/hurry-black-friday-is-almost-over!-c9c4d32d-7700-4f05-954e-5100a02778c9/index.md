I don't know why this bugs me so much. I just got an email today with the subject line telling me that Black Friday is almost over. How can Black Friday be almost over when it hasn't even started yet??

It used to be the day after Thanksgiving (Black Friday) was the biggest shopping day of the year. Then Amazon came along and Cyber Monday was added to the list. Now it seems the whole week of Thanksgiving and up to Christmas Eve will be fair game. Is this good for the consumer? I guess if you can get deals on stuff you NEED then maybe it is. Still, it seems like we are close to reaching or have reached "peak consumerism."

Here's a trivia question for you.

In 2019, the biggest shopping day of the year was NOT Black Friday or Cyber Monday. What day was it?

Answer: The last Saturday before Christmas dubbed "Super Saturday." Nothing like waiting until the last minute.

I also discovered the dirty little secret of all holiday gift guides. It's just a bunch of affiliate marketing! Well, I'm going to hop on the bandwagon this year and release my holiday gift guide on Cyber Monday. It won't be just a bunch of random stuff designed to get people to make purchases and earn me commissions. I have curated only the best stuff that I use myself and truly recommend.

Okay, I'll end on a positive note. The [latest issue of the Be Wellthy newsletter](https://bewellthy.substack.com/p/giving-thanks) asks everyone to focus on gratitude. That's where I will end. I am grateful to still be kicking after a truly crazy year. And if you haven't subscribed yet, what are you waiting for? In a few short weeks, you "won't have Nixon to kick around anymore."
