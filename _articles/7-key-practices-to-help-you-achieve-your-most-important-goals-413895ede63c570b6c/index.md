I would like to get rid of my Facebook account and be done with it. Then I see a gem like this and get sucked back in. 

No telling stories or making you wait for them. Here are the 7 practices:

1.  Have a deep reason.
2.  Find meaning being uncomfortable.
3.  Prioritize systems over willpower.
4.  Separate your feelings from your identity.
5.  Use behavior to change negative feelings.
6.  Use low moments to your advantage.
7.  View life as a series of learnable skills and practice them.

Having a deep reason is very important. By the way, "I want to make more money" or "I want to provide for my family" or "I want to be healthier" are NOT deep reasons. You need to go much deeper than that. 

It's not easy getting uncomfortable, but if you find meaning in it then it might be easier to go there more often.

Willpower is not your friend.

I will keep saying this phrase because I believe it to be true: 

> Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it. 

You have power over your feelings and you have the ability to change how you are thinking or how you are feeling. In fact, if you don't actively control your thoughts or emotions, they will control you.

Discuss.
