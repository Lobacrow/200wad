I love my AirPods. I found out that the AirPods are the best reviewed Apple product in history. I can understand why. AirPods exemplify the concept that "they just work."

This is why I was extremely disappointed yesterday when I lost one AirPod. I have always been good about keeping them both in the case. Of course, the one time I take one and put it in my jacket pocket it goes missing.Â 

Yes, I was frustrated and mad at myself. I use AirPods everyday. So I can be bitter about it or think about it in a positive way. Instead of dwelling on the negative, I choose to stay positive.

*   I am fortunate enough to have AirPods in the first place.  
    
*   I still have the Left AirPod that works by itself.
*   I mostly listen to Podcasts, and I can listen to those with one ear easily.
*   I can get a replacement AirPod for $69, which is cheaper than buying a new set.

The lesson is that stuff happens to everyone. What is important is how you react to it. Being bitter or mad at myself is not productive. I cannot change what happened, but I can learn from it.
