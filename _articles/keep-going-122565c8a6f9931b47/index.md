I could have used the title "Don't stop." What's the difference between "don't stop" and "keep going?"

Focus.

If I tell you do NOT picture a giraffe, you are going to picture a giraffe. But I told you DON'T do that. It doesn't matter.

  

If you are on the wrong path, change course and keep going.

If you are on the right path, keep going.Â 

If it feels like you are not making any progress, keep going.

If no one encourages you on your journey, keep going.

If you are worried about what other people think of you, keep going.  

If you are worried about what you think of yourself, keep going.

If it feels like it's never going to get any easier, keep going.

If it seems like you are never going to reach your goal, keep going.

If you are tired and don't have the energy, keep going.

If you are scared of making a mistake, keep going.

If you want to achieve the greatness you are meant for, keep going.

  

I can't believe I'm going to quote a Miley Cyrus song from _Hannah Montana: The Movie._ What can I say, this song really says it all.

_I can almost see it_

_That dream I'm dreamin'_

_But there's a voice inside my head saying_

_You'll never reach it_

_Every step I'm taking_

_Every move I make_

_Feels lost with no direction_

_My faith is shaken_

_But I_

_I gotta keep tryin'_

_Gotta keep my head held high_

_There's always gonna be another mountain_

_I'm always gonna wanna make it move_

_Always gonna be an uphill battle_

_Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose_

_Ain't about how fast I get there_

_Ain't about what's waiting on the other side_

_It's the climb_

For the people who have joined me on this journey so far, thank you for reading. For the people who haven't joined me yet, thank you too because that means I still have more work to do.

Keep going.
