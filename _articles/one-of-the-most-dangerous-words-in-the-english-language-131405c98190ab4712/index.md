The word: **maybe**

The problem with the word "maybe" is that it is non-committal. People like to use the word "maybe" because it leaves open the possibility. It's nice to have more options rather than fewer options.Â 

_"Hey, you want to go to that concert next month?"_

_"You want to grab a bite to eat next weekend?"_

_"Are you interested in buying some Girl Scout cookies?"_

"Maybe" seems like a great answer to questions like these. These are rather harmless questions, and whether you commit to any of them is not a big deal. But what about more important questions?

_"Are you interested in going to that entrepreneur seminar?"_

_"Are you going to apply for that new job?"_

_"Are you going to work out this week?"_

_"Are you going to schedule that doctor visit?"_

"Maybe" is a terrible answer for the questions that matter. It's a copout. For the questions that you ask yourself, for the questions that matter, do not use maybe. Commit to a definitive answer and follow through on your commitments. That doesn't mean the answer is always yes. Sometimes the answer is no. Sometimes the answer is not right now. Just don't let the answer be maybe.
