Apparently, there is something called a "Super Blood Wolf Moon Eclipse" occurring this evening in North America. A lunar eclipse occurs when the earth is between the moon and the sun as opposed to a solar eclipse in which the moon is between the earth and the sun. You can stare at a lunar eclipse without harm. You shouldn't stare at a solar eclipse without special glasses. A certain President did not heed this advice during the last solar eclipse.

I do not read anything special into an event like an eclipse. It just happens to be a result of the positions of celestial bodies in space. It is, however, a reminder of our place in the galaxy and the universe. 

For thousands of years, mankind looked up at the mysterious moon until one day we stepped on lunar soil (sorry conspiracy theorists, I do believe we landed on the moon.) 

The phrase "moonshot" refers to an audacious goal. When I stare up at the lunar eclipse tonight, I will be thinking about all the other people who looked at that same moon and dared to dream big. It will be a good reminder for me to dream big for myself. Perhaps I will ponder my own moonshot for my life. Some big, audacious goal that may seem impossible. Or maybe that's just lunacy.
