Most people start their careers in entry-level jobs making minimum wage or a modest amount. The dream, of course, is to do a good job, get promoted, and eventually, make more money. 

You start out measuring raises in cents. You talk about getting a twenty-five-cent raise or a fifty-cent raise. Eventually, you might move from an hourly job to a salaried job, otherwise known as an "exempt" position. Say goodbye to over time (and for many people much of your free time) in these positions. But your raises are now measured as a percentage of salary or dollar amount added to your annual salary. But you don't care about that number. You care about the number in your paycheck. Sure, $2500 per year increase sounds like a lot, until you look at your check and see the net amount went up by $40.

When you make a modest salary, you have more freedom to move. You can swap one job for another, even in different industries, because the pay is similar. Once you start moving up the ladder and making more money, it becomes more difficult to get off the train. Most people live the lifestyle afforded by their salary or as divorce lawyers like to say, "the lifestyle to which one has become accustomed." 

Don't let this happen to you. Don't stay in an industry you don't like just for the money or a false sense of security. One day you'll be happy with your finances but you'll be unfulfilled. 

How do you break out of this vicious cycle? You start working on yourself. You educate yourself. You become better physically and mentally. You reduce your lifestyle and save money to plan for an eventual exit. And you make the most of your free time to pursue things that matter. 

Then you take the leap and do it. You show people what is possible. Then you do whatever you can to help others do the same thing. 

The cat's out of the bag now. This is my game plan. I'm not where I want to be yet, but I've got a plan to get there.

Well, it's been a year and all I can say is easier said than done. I still have the same day job. I get paid well for what I do, but it takes up much of my time and I'm not passionate about it. I pretty much know what I want my days to look like if I didn't have this pesky job thing. What I don't know is how to generate income on my own. 

Let me re-phrase. I can generate money on my own. I can use my skills to provide services in exchange for money. I've done that before. The kicker is to do this _consistently_. A job does give you a consistent paycheck (as long as you don't get fired or laid off). 

I've gotten very good at having a job and succeeding in the business world. It's a double whammy: I have to walk away from what many would call a successful career and start all over again as a beginner. Many of the skills I have honed over the years do not translate to an entrepreneurial endeavor. There are many skills I simply don't have. It sucks starting from the beginning.

I'm doing it anyway. I can see the relatively safe path of doing the same thing for another 20 years and then do something called "retirement." I'm not interested in that path. 

A year has gone by, and I still don't feel like I'm any closer to my goals and dreams. That's okay. This year is all about points on the board. I'm holding myself accountable, and next year I will return to this post with something more than hope and dreams.
