I have reached a point where I have to have controversies actually explained to me now. The latest one that puzzled me is related to a new book called _American Dirt_. This novel tells the fictional story of a Mexican mother and son's journey to the border after a cartel murders the rest of their family. In January, Oprah announced this book as the latest pick for her book club saying, "From the first sentence, I was IN...like so many of us, I've read newspaper articles and watched television news stories and seen movies about the plight of families looking for a better life, but this story changed the way I see what it means to be a migrant in a whole new way."

So what's the controversy? The book was written by a woman who identifies as white. I guess this is a problem since stories can only come from the people who live them? 

Look. I'm half white and half Hispanic with ancestors who came from Mexico. I like to joke that if you're going to give me money, I'm Hispanic. If you're going to deport me, I'm white. 

I've never really identified with a specific culture, so it is hard for me to understand the perspectives of people who do. 

If you want to read more about this controversy, [this article](https://www.vulture.com/2020/02/american-dirt-book-controversy-explained.html) seems to be a good summary.
