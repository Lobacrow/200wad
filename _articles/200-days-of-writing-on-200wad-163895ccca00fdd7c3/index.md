After 200 days of writing on 200WAD, I have a decent selection of posts. Most of them are of the standard, run-of-the-mill variety. Then there are a few that might have inklings of something special.

When tv shows or radio shows are on long enough, they create "best of" episodes of what the creators deem to be the best moments. 

As a milestone to celebrate 200 posts, I am going to select my own Best Of list. I encourage anyone on #Teamstreak who reaches the 200 Club to do the same thing starting with @basilesamel @valentino @vickenstein In fact, I will help you curate your list if you would like assistance. 

I combed through every one of my posts on 200WAD. This is a tough mission because there are some posts that I'm particularly fond of, but they may not be hits with the masses. Then again, there might be other posts that resonated within the community but to me are nothing special. So, the list will probably change, but I gotta start somewhere. By the way, if you can point to a post that didn't make the list but you think should have, let me know.

Without further adieu, here is the start of my Best Of collection.
