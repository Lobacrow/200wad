Spoiler-free Edition

Without question, my favorite television show of all time is _Breaking Bad._ I did not start watching the show until season 3 was well underway. By the time the fourth season started, I was watching live and took the ride all the way to the end.

There are so many great aspects of the show. The actors are superb. The dialog is fantastic. The cinematography of the show is at the scale of full-length feature films. The show takes place in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which is a character in itself. The plots and twists and suspense, especially in the last season, had me on the edge of my seat. I was extremely satisfied with the last season and the finale. Many of the character arcs and plotlines were wrapped up in a satisfying way. While there was some uncertainty about what was next for one of the main characters, Jesse, I was happy to have the series end where it did. The show ended after five seasons in September of 2013. 

In the meantime, the creators and writers of _Breaking Bad_ developed the spin-off _Better Call Saul._ This show occurs in the same _Breaking Bad_ universe with some crossover characters including the titular Saul Goodman. _Better Call Saul_'s first season started in February of 2015 and finished its fourth season in October of 2018. Disappointingly, we are not set to get new episodes until next year.

Fast forward to 2019. We now have a _Breaking Bad_ movie called _El Camino_, which takes place after the events in the series finale. As soon as the movie was announced by Netflix, I was beyond excited. I don't think I've been this excited for a movie since _Star Wars: The Force Awakens_. 

I just finished El Camino. It felt more like a long episode than a movie. That's fine. I enjoyed it. It was nice to see these characters again after all these years. 

I didn't _need_ to have a movie after _Breaking Bad_. Just like I don't _need_ to have dessert after a spectacular feast. _El Camino_ is the dessert that I didn't need, but I consumed it anyway and I'm glad I did. It was worth it.

_Breaking Bad_ is a wild ride and worth the investment. Just be sure to order the _El Camino_ dessert when you're finished with your feast.
