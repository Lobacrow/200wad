One year ago, [#Teamstreak was created on 200WAD](https://cowriters.app/words/teamstreak-142075caa037302bfc). I haven't looked at that post in a long time, and I have to say it gets me fired up. 

My team is about consistency.

My team is about showing up every day.

My team is about no excuses.

My team is about publishing every day no matter what happens.

I'm here every day because I want to be here. I see the benefits of this practice. It allows me to practice the art of not letting myself off the hook.

"It's one day off. What's the big deal?"

"It's only one cupcake."

"You've had a long day. You should take it easy. You don't need to exercise every day."

No excuses. 

#Teamstreak is down to twelve people. I feel like saying, "Twelve!?" like Thomas Andrews exclaimed when he discovered that a lifeboat was sent from the Titanic with only twelve people on board.

It's not for everyone. Things happen. But some of us are still here. I want to spotlight the people who are still on #Teamstreak one year later:

@basilesamel

@jasonleow

@knight

@arcticloon

@efran

I'm proud of you all. I admire your relentless pursuit to continue writing and improving. I'm so glad that you gave no excuses and you stayed on the journey with me. 

Every single day.

I hope to see you all still here in another year. 

We are #Teamstreak!!!!
