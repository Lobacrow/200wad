I am using the free [Scribe book writing course](https://scribewriting.com/course/book-writing/) to guide me through the process of writing a book. The chapter after the introduction is called Fear Solving.

**What am I afraid might happen with my book?**

*   I'm afraid my book isn't original. There are plenty of books out there about sleep.Â 
*   I'm afraid I will put all the knowledge, research, and effort into the book and hardly anyone will read it and get value from it.
*   I'm afraid people will somehow make their sleep worse rather than better because of the information in the book.
*   I'm afraid I will come across as too strict about sleep, which will turn off people from hearing the message and taking action.
*   I'm afraid the tips and advice I provide will not work for people's individual needs and circumstances causing me to lose credibility.

**Are these fears realistic? Any chance they could happen?**

None of these fears are impossible. But I think most of them are unlikely or would only result in minor outcomes or negative effects.

**What are the consequences if the fears come true?**

*   People won't read my book because the information already exists in books by authors who are more well known or seen as more knowledgeable/credible.
*   Seemingly I did all the work for nothing because no one read the book and received value.
*   Some people with sleep disorders or other challenges make their sleep worse, doing the opposite of what my book promises.
*   People may start to read the book but then stop and take no action because of how the message is delivered.
*   People will read the book, not improve sleep, and give bad reviews or tell people the tips and techniques don't work.

**Deal with the fears later!**
