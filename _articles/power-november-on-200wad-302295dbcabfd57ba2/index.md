Usually, this time of year is when people start to take the foot off the gas. Take some vacations. Visit with family. Take it easy. You have Thanksgiving and Christmas and of course endless shopping. I think you can do all those things and still keep pushing forward without losing momentum.

I feel like we are in store for a Power November in the 200WAD community.

@keni is spearheading an exciting writing competition

@abrahamkim is on a roll with a new podcast episode every other week

@basilesamel has trimmed down his obligations and renewed his focus on enhancements and improvements to 200WAD.

I see new members joining consistently. People are writing books. I see previous members of #Teamstreak joining once again. I see people joining the 200 Club and 300 Club. Baz is within striking distance of being the first to reach the 1-year club.  

Our little corner of the internet is steadily growing one person at a time writing 200 words at a time. 

In May, I wrote that [people have the power](https://200wordsaday.com/words/people-have-the-power-181665ce55662e948d). I believe it. The power is growing stronger. This community is special, and we have the foundation on which to build some truly great things. 

It's time for Power November.
