Today is actually January 1st. I like saying, "Today is January 1st" when it's not January 1st to remind myself that each day is a new day to start something. I'm intentionally not starting anything new today to buck the New Year's resolution trend.

My [theme for 2020 is Points on the Board](https://200wordsaday.com/words/my-theme-for-2020-points-on-the-board-334455e076f491ef75). There is one action I need to hone into a master skill to make this happen.

Focus.

For the main job that pays the bills, I have excellent focus. I'm not passionate about the work, but that doesn't mean I bring anything less than my best effort. For some reason, though, I have not brought that level of focus to my pursuits outside the main job. Maybe it's because I don't want another "job" or something that feels like a job. 

I know how to fire up the laser of focus, I just need to aim it in the right place. I've spent enough time dabbling in different topics and areas of interest. It's time to narrow down the list and go a mile deep. 

I have decided that the over-arching topic of interest is health. Within the health space, I am most focused on the topics of sleep and nutrition. 

Well, that wasn't so hard. Now time to take action.

Time to focus.
