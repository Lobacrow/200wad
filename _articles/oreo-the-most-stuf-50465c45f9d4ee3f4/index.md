I recently saw an article announcing that Nabisco is releasing a limited edition version of the Oreo cookie called "The Most Stuf." For those unfamiliar with Oreo cookies, these cookies are comprised of two thin chocolate wafer cookies with cream in the middle. 

One of the common strategies for eating Oreo cookies is to grasp the two wafers and separate them to be able to lick and eat the cream. When I used to eat Oreo cookies as a kid, my strategy was to dunk them in a glass of milk for a few seconds and then eat the whole thing.

Double Stuf Oreos allegedly have twice the amount of cream in the middle. This new "The Most Stuf" Oreo cookie supposedly has three times the cream in the middle.

At some point, this will get ridiculous if it hasn't already. What makes an Oreo cookie work is the contrast between the two elements. The dry chocolate wafers would not be good by themselves. The cream would be super sweet and not good by itself in large quantities. It is the cookie-to-cream ratio that identifies an Oreo cookie, and it appears now there is another option for those who just can't get enough of the cream. I do admit I used to select the Double Stuf Oreos over the originals.

For the calorie counters here is the summary:

One regular Oreo cookie:

*   53 calories  
    
*   2.3 g fat
*   8.3 g carbs

One Double Stuf Oreo cookie:

*   70 calories  
    
*   3.5 g fat
*   10.5 g carbs

One The Most Stuf Oreo cookie:

*   110 calories  
    
*   ?? fat
*   ?? carbs

Even if my local grocery store carries this new item, I will take a pass by using my strategy of avoiding milk, which is a [gateway food to bad eating](https://200wordsaday.com/words/milk-is-a-gateway-food-to-bad-eating-43495c3e5c6a94b82). But if anyone tries these new culinary delights, please let me know how they are!
