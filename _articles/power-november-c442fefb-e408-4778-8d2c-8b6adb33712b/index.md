Usually, this time of year is when people start to take the foot off the gas. Take some vacations. Visit with family. Take it easy. You have Thanksgiving and Christmas and of course endless shopping. I think you can do all those things and still keep pushing forward without losing momentum.

I feel like we are in store for a Power November in the 200WAD community.

@keni is spearheading an exciting writing competition

@abrahamkim is on a roll with a new podcast episode every other week

@basilesamel has trimmed down his obligations and renewed his focus on enhancements and improvements to 200WAD.

I see new members joining consistently. People are writing books. I see previous members of [#Teamstreak](#Teamstreak) joining once again. I see people joining the 200 Club and 300 Club. Baz is within striking distance of being the first to reach the 1-year club.

Our little corner of the internet is steadily growing one person at a time writing 200 words at a time.

In May, I wrote that [people have the power](https://200wordsaday.com/words/people-have-the-power-181665ce55662e948d). I believe it. The power is growing stronger. This community is special, and we have the foundation on which to build some truly great things.

It's time for Power November.

The keep on writing feature is missing, so I had to go find this post from a year ago and copy/paste it. What a difference a year makes! I see why people keep diaries because of the act of doing it each day and then the added benefit of reflecting on the writings down the road. It is interesting that I rediscovered the post that people have the power, especially in light of the big election in the US this week.

Baz has been rather quiet lately, so I don't know whether we are going to have a rebirth or if I'm going down with the ship.Â 

Wallace Hartley was an English violinist and the bandleader on the RMS Titanic when it sank on its maiden voyage. As the story goes, Hartley and the 8-piece band were playing on the deck as the crew loaded passengers onto lifeboats. Many of the survivors indicated that the band continued to play until the very end. As Hartley and the remaining band members were dragged down with the hull, Hartley was heard to say to his fellow colleagues, "Gentlemen, I bid you farewell!"

I hope the ship is not sinking, but if it is, I'm going to be playing my music until the end.
