Last night was the last night in Vegas, and my girlfriend and I got last-minute tickets to see Penn and Teller. Penn and Teller is a duo of magicians (illusionists if you will) comprised of Penn Jillette and Raymond Teller. Penn is the tall, outspoken one and Teller is the short, quiet one who performs with body language and facial expressions.

As a kid, I liked watching magic shows and magicians on TV. I remember watching David Copperfield walk through the Great Wall of China and make the Statue of Liberty disappear. Sometimes you just want to feel like a kid again.

Prior to the show, I bought a cocktail. I was deliberating whether to pay more for the souvenir cup. I had planned to pass on that since it was plastic and not likely something I would use in the future. Somehow I ended up with the cup anyway.

Penn and Teller engaged with the audience and brought several people on stage to participate in various tricks. The seasoned performers know exactly how to pace a show and entertain the audience. We were so engrossed that an hour and fifteen minutes felt like twenty.

After the show, Penn and Teller walked off stage down into the aisles through the audience and exited the theater. We soon discovered that each man was in the lobby taking selfies with audience members. I had heard that they do this, but I thought it was random. I did not expect them to do this after every show but they do.

I was so happy to have the souvenir cup, which provided the perfect vehicle to obtain autographs from both Penn and Teller. There wasn't much time to interact because of the crowd of people waiting for selfies. I made it a point to tell Penn, "It is so great to see someone doing what he was born to do." He responded, "That's very kind of you to say. Thank you."

Penn and Teller have been performing together since 1975. That's longer than I have been alive. They have been performing at the Rio since 2001, which makes them the longest-running headliners to play in the same Las Vegas hotel. And yet after every show, they make themselves available to the audience and stay until every last person takes a picture with them.

I have been in my industry since 2001. I'm definitely not meeting with the audience members after the show. I know I'm not doing what I was born to do. I don't even know what that is.

But I am confident I will find my purpose. I know I'm getting closer to it.Â 

You get one life. Cherish the time you have with the people you love. Enjoy moments when you can feel like a kid again. Life is magical, after all, even for a skeptic.
