Tomorrow I am heading out to Las Vegas. It's about a 5.5-hour drive. I am attending another weekend of personal development training. It's Friday night, all day Saturday and all day Sunday. 

I have been looking forward to this event for multiple reasons. First and foremost: my girlfriend and my best friend and his wife will be joining me. It's always better to experience these events with people rather than solo. And I know they will be blown away.

Another reason is very personal. I attended this event last year. When I look back at the trajectory from October 2018 to October 2019 in terms of my personal development, mentality, focus, and discipline, this event moved the needle for me. 

What's great about this event is that it is a collection of characters and skits performed by one of the greatest trainers I have ever had the privilege to see. I'm talking Tony Robbins-level good. Rather than read a description, take a look at the [promo video](https://youtu.be/4DGacgJd1lg) for this year's event if you are curious. 

I've said it many times. You can read all the books, listen to all the podcasts, watch all the YouTube videos, put quotes all over your phone and bathroom mirror. In fact, do all of those things because you have to be careful about what you pay attention to. Just like food is fuel for the body and brain, where you focus your attention is fuel for your mind. If you want to take your personal development to the next level, you need to experience a live event.

I know @keni was overwhelmed at an event where Tony Robbins blew the roof off the arena. It can be a bit much if you aren't used to it. I'm an introvert, and the first live event I went to was a bit much. It put me out of my comfort zone. That's sort of the idea.

I will be more occupied than normal this weekend, so I won't post my summary of the event until I return home.
