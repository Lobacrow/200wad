It's that time of the year. In the office, you arrive at your desk and find various envelopes with your name on them. In your mailbox, you sift through all the catalogs and find more festive envelopes. For some reason, many people continue to carry on the long tradition of sending holiday/Christmas cards. 

Most of these are a waste of time and here's why. You spend the time and money to buy the stationery. You sign each card, address all the envelopes, buy the stamps, and mail them out. That's a lot of work and for what? So I can see that you thought of me by sending a generic card where all you did was sign your name. But it's the thought that counts, right?

I like Christmas cards where people are creative. Sometimes it's just a picture of the family. Those are nice. Sometimes the card includes a nicely-written summary of the year. On a rare occasion, the card will actually include heartfelt comments. If you are going to take the time and money to buy supplies, address envelopes, and mail cards to many people, why not make it worth it? 

It's too late this year but maybe next year I will update this tradition. I will send holiday/Christmas cards that are specific and meaningful. Much to the chagrin of Hallmark, I have started creating my own cards for birthdays and special occasions. It's more than the thought of sending a card that counts.
