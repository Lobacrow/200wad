People say the hardest part is getting started. Taking that first step. Is that harder than taking the 100th step or the 1000th step? Some say, "Well don't worry it gets easier." Maybe that's wishful thinking. Some say, "It only gets harder." That's probably true and that sucks.

It doesn't matter where you are in your journey, every level has a new devil.
