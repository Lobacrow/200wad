> Success is 80% psychology and 20% mechanics. --Tony Robbins

I am fascinated with how our decisions and habits direct our lives. I recently watched a video delivered by Tony Robbins (before the big news storm broke) and want to summarize his topic.

There are three key decisions that control the outcome of your life.

1\. **Do you focus on what you have or what you're missing?** Successful people focus on what they have. They practice gratitude. Unsuccessful people focus on what they don't have. While it's good to dream big and focus on the end goal, one needs to be grateful and appreciative of where he or she is.

2\. **Do you focus on what you can control or can't control?** Successful people focus on what they can control. Unsuccessful people get distracted by things they cannot control.Â 

3\. **Do you focus on the past, present, or future?** While it is good to remember the past and the knowledge and experience gained, successful people focus on the present and also on the future. Unsuccessful people focus too much on the past while life passes them by.

The big takeaway for me is that once again it comes back to focus. Where you direct your mind is where you will go.
