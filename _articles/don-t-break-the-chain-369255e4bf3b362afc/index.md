This [article](https://lifehacker.com/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret-281626) explains a productivity secret from Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry said he realized that in order to be a better comic he needed to create better jokes. The way to create better jokes was to write every day. To accomplish this, Jerry used a simple calendar system.

He got a big wall calendar with the whole year on one page and hung it on the wall where he would see it every day. Then he got a big red magic marker. For every day that he completed his writing task, he put a big red X over that day. Here is the most important part:

> After a few days you'll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You'll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain.

Daily action builds habits. Think of it as the [1% Rule](https://200wordsaday.com/words/the-1-rule-for-creating-all-habits-91495c672c4f4bfc4). This explains the beauty of 200WAD. People who are writing a book like @basilesamel know that writing a bit each day and every day over time will create much better results compared to sitting down one or two days a week to cram in a bunch of thoughts.

Maybe it's a calendar and a big red magic marker that will do the trick as it did for Seinfeld. Maybe it's a checklist on your phone. Maybe it's the fire icon of the streak on 200WAD (my personal favorite). Whatever tool you need to hold yourself accountable, find what works for you and use it.

Some people ask which is harder, taking that first step or keeping it going after the first step. Who cares. The point is to start. 

And don't break the chain.

I like returning to posts from one year ago and revisiting them. Of course, you have to write for a year to be granted this perk. Little did I know a year later that I would be one of "those people writing a book." ?

I had my quarterly meeting with my financial adviser, and when I told him about my daily writing practice he had all kinds of questions.

*   Where do you write?
*   Do you have a scheduled time you write every day?
*   Do you have a minimum number of words?
*   How have you stayed consistent and not missed a day?

Unlike Seinfeld, I don't use a calendar. I track many habits on a habit app, but writing is not one of them. Because of my travel schedule, I do not have a scheduled time of writing every day. I just get it done. If I write early in the morning, sometimes I get a moment of panic at bedtime. "Wait, I posted today right??" Yep, that still happens.

I'm an OG and still write at least 200 words even though there is no limit. This just feels right to me, although often times my posts tend to be much longer compared to when I first started writing.

I wish I could give you a magical prescription, but I don't have one. A good first step is to join #Teamstreak. If you can reach 30 days of writing, you prove to yourself that it's possible. This helps to reduce the fears and doubts you have about yourself. After that, the sky is the limit. Whether you continue really depends on why you're doing it and your goals.  

At least we have seven people in the 400 Club, so I'm not the only oddball.
