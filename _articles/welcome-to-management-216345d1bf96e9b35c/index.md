After a hiatus of about 4.5 years, I have returned to a management role this time as a consultant instead of a full-time employee. Before becoming a consultant, I was a Configuration Manager at a Fortune 50 health insurance company. Yes, for those who don't know I am in the glamorous industry known as healthcare insurance.

I left that management position in a state of burnout. I wrote about that time period in an article in which I encourage people to [write a resignation letter on the first day of a new job](https://medium.com/the-ascent/on-the-first-day-of-your-new-job-you-should-write-your-resignation-letter-be16563bfab9). At the time and for years after, I believed that I would never take on another management position.

What's different this time around? Well, as a consultant my role is somewhat limited by design. I don't have to deal with any of the HR stuff, which is a big plus. Consultants work on a billable hour basis, so my hours are capped. I won't have any more of the 70- and 80-hour weeks I used to have. Also, I have confidence that I can provide value to the client and help them achieve significant improvements.

I started my new role on Monday, July 1st. First thing in the morning in the span of about three minutes I received eight meeting requests. Welcome to management!
