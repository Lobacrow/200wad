As of this writing, the next movie dropped to #3 on the list of all-time gross sales at the box office knocked off the number #2 spot by _Avengers: Endgame._ I am referring to the movie _Titanic_, which came out in 1997. This movie holds my personal record of most times seeing a movie in the theater. I lost track actually, but it is somewhere around 7-8 times.

I was swept up by the history of this event. The ending is not a surprise, but that does not take away from experiencing what life was like for the short time on the Titanic and the tragic end. The main characters are fictional, but their stories are interwoven nicely with characters who are based on real people.

There are parts of this movie that are very emotional for me. The musical score adds to the melancholy of what was supposed to be a crowning achievement of humanity.Â 

Yes it's a long movie running over three hours. Some people quibble with the emphasis on the relationship between Rose and Jack. Nonetheless, the accurate portrayal of the ship including the sinking, which was as accurate as was believed at the time, provided a realism for me that inspired me to learn more about the time period and the Titanic. In my opinion, this is Hollywood movie-making at its best.
