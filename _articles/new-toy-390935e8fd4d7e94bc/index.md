I've had my MacBook since it came out in 2017. It's been a great laptop save for one glaring flaw--the keyboard. I'm not alone in my opinion. Apple admitted as much by redesigning the keyboard in the latest MacBook Pro, calling it the magic keyboard. I don't know what's so magic about it, but the reviews indicate the design has been much improved.  

I type A LOT. Even though I'm not traveling now, I still prefer to use my laptop. After spending 10+ hours sitting at a computer (a PeeCee no less), the last thing I want to do is sit in front of my iMac. I'd rather grab my laptop and chill out on the couch.

Fast forward to last month when Apple introduced a shiny new MacBook Air. Yes, it has all the usual bells and whistles for a new Apple laptop, and most importantly it has the magic keyboard! I suppose could I have waited for the MacBook Pro 13", which is due for a refresh (and most likely magic keyboard) in a couple of months, but I have never had a Pro laptop. I don't need to spend the money on all that power.

I decided to see how much my three-year-old MacBook would be worth to trade in. I went with Apple's third-party option, and I was able to get $480 credit. That made the decision easy for me. I boxed up my MacBook last week and just received my Apple store gift card today. Within minutes, I had ordered the shiny new space gray MacBook Air. 

I would normally pick it up, but the Apple stores are all closed. The new toy is scheduled to arrive April 17-24. Always great looking forward to a new Apple product.
