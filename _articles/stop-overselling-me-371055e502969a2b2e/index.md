I recently heard about a new supplement I want to try. I went to the website and stepped into what I now know is called a "sales funnel."

I arrived at the website. I already told you I'm ready to purchase what I came for. Rather than proceeding to check out, I am given another page to buy some other supplement. I have no interest in this other supplement, which is probably a low seller anyway. Not only has my purchase been delayed, but I was also insulted by the description of the "No" link that suggests that by clicking it, I am agreeing to continue to have low levels of testosterone and less overall "manliness."

I faced two more pages of products I do not want and insults levied at me for declining additional purchases. I almost canceled the purchase on principle. But I really wanted to try the supplement.

I suppose this is the online equivalent of the check-out lane, which has every manner of gum, candy, and small items ready for you to make a snap purchase as you wait to check out. I'm sure there is a science behind why some selling is done this way. I'm sure it leads to more sales because if it didn't, they would change tactics. Maybe most people don't get annoyed by things like this. I do.

Once I've agreed to buy your product, stop overselling me. You already got the sale, and if that product is as good as you say it is, I'll be back.
