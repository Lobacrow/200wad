Cocktail party pitch

Imagine your ideal reader read the book and got tremendous value and now all they want to do is tell other people about the book.

Why do people share?

1\. They took a lot of value from the book.

2\. Sharing the book makes them look good.

In other words, they focus on the main benefits of the book, and they state them simply and directly.

My cocktail party pitch: Hey, I read this great book about sleep. It's not written by a doctor or scientist, just some guy who wanted to improve his sleep and did all the work. He's got some funny stories in there and a lot of great tips about sleep. There are so many things you do throughout the day that you don't even realize affect your sleep. I got a sleep tracker and started testing out some of the tips and I have been sleeping so much better. There wasn't a lot of fluff in the book. He got right to the good stuff. You should check it out.

North Star check - This is a technique to tie in the concepts for the book idea.

I will use my book to target \[primary audience\], by teaching them \[problems solved/benefits gained\], which will lead to my ultimate goal of more \[objectives\].

I will use my book to target adults 30 and older (without sleeping disorders) by explaining why sleep is a fundamental pillar of health and providing tips and techniques to improve sleep to increase energy, improve focus, and help them become healthier individuals.
