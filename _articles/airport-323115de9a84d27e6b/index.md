I'm sitting at the airport people watching because my flight is delayed. The airport is one of the few places in which you will see people walking stridently and with purpose in one direction and then a few minutes later, the same people are walking just as confidently in the opposite direction. 

It's also a place where people love talking on the phone. It's so noisy I don't know how they can hear anything. On top of that, these phone calls are so important that they must be conducted in the men's room, waiting in line to board, and while boarding the plane. 

Emotions should be kept under control at the airport. One's general demeanor should range between serious and unemotional. There should be little if any laughter or merriment. The exception is children who typically cannot control their emotions. Children can laugh their heads off because I would much rather listen to laughing than crying.

My flight is delayed for 1.5 hours, but I still arrive at the airport at my normal time. Southwest has tricked me before by announcing a delay, which caused me to stop on the way to the airport, only to announce 15 minutes later that the flight was back on schedule. Knowing that is a possibility, I don't mess around. The last thing I want is the hassle associated with a missed flight.

I lose an hour traveling back to AZ, so I will not arrive home until after 11 PM. This is no bueno for sleep, but it's out of my control. How do I recover? No messing around tomorrow. I will be in bed earlier than normal, hopefully by 8:00 PM to get my sleep schedule back on track.
