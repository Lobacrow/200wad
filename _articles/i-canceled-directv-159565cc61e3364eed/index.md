When I was a kid I remember we had a brown cable box with a remote control tethered to it with a long cord. I believe HBO was channel 1. Throughout my years growing up we always had cable. This changed when I was in college where I relied on an antenna to get local channels for a few years. But once out of college and on my own, when I moved to an apartment the first thing I did was get internet and the second thing I did was get cable. 

In 2010 I switched from cable to satellite TV. It was cheaper and overall a better experience. I've had some form of cable or satellite TV for the last twenty years. In fact, I'm on record as saying the DVR is my favorite non-Apple device. 

It's time for a change. I will free up some time by eliminating the temptation to watch content that has been conveniently recorded. I will also free up the monthly expense. 

I suppose it's easier to become a "cord-cutter" nowadays with all the other options available. I do have an AppleTV with access to Amazon Prime content as well as HBO (until _Game of Thrones_ ends) and I'm keeping Netflix (I haven't totally lost my mind.)

I'm reminded of a couple years ago when I told a friend of mine I was getting rid of the TV in my bedroom, and he thought that was a crazy idea and something he'd never do. My past self might think the same thing about getting rid of cable/satellite TV. Sorry, old friend, but it's really for the best.
