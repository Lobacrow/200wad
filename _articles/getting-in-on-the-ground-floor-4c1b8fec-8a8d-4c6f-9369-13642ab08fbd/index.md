When I first started as a configuration analyst, the department was called Business Application Management. Everyone called it BAM. I found out the director floated a different name before that one: Business Application Development and Support Services. That name was vetoed by the VP after he realized the nickname would be "BADASS."  
  
People would get together for happy hours, and these became known as "BAM" happy hours because of the conversations and personalities that would undoubtedly make it an interesting gathering. At one of these BAM happy hours, there was a fellow configuration analyst named Andrew who notified the group that he was leaving the company. He told us that he was getting in on the ground floor of some start-up and he couldn't be more excited. He even had a few of us thinking about jumping ship, if for only a moment.  
  
It's exciting to be on the ground floor of something new. There's uncertainty but also excitement about the possibilities. I don't think it worked out well for Andrew based on what I heard, but he survived. The good news is that when you're on the ground floor, you don't have far to fall. Then again, I'm not planning to fall.  
  
We're going to build this together, and I couldn't be more excited.

Who else is ready to get in on the ground floor?
