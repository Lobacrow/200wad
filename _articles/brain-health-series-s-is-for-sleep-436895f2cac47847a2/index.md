S is for Sleep

I finally made it to the last item, which happens to be my favorite topic.

When you are sleeping, your brain is hard at work performing some very critical functions necessary to keep it operating at optimal levels. 

Sleep and brain health/mental health issues are tightly linked. Chronic insomnia affects approximately one in ten people. The rates are even higher among people with psychiatric disorders. More than 50% of the time, insomnia is tied to stress, anxiety, or depression.

With increasing insomnia rates, sleep aid medications have skyrocketed. But the sleep solutions our society is pushing come with a cost. Research showed an association between sleep medications--such as Ambien, Lunesta, and Restoril--and a more than three-fold increased risk of death. These sleep aids have also been associated with memory issues, confusion, anxiety, depression, and addiction.

Having too few hours of sleep can have catastrophic consequences, increasing your risk of a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Drivers who slept six to seven hours were 30% more likely to be in a car crash than those who got more than seven hours; those who slept for five to six hours a night were 90% more likely to have an accident. In another study, soldiers who got seven hours of sleep at night were 98% accurate on the range; those who got six hours of sleep were only 50 percent accurate. 

Beware of health problems that steal your sleep:

*   sleep apnea - leads you to stop breathing for short periods of time throughout the night, leaving you dragging, unfocused, and forgetful throughout the day not to mention bad on the heart
*   restless leg syndrome
*   thyroid conditions
*   congestive heart failure
*   chronic pain
*   untreated or undertreated mental health issues such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), depression, or anxiety
*   Alzheimer's disease
*   chronic gastrointestinal problems such as acid reflux
*   enlarged prostate gland leading to frequent urination

Beware of bad sleep habits:

*   Bedroom is too warm.
*   Light in the bedroom.
*   Noise.
*   Gadgets by the bed.
*   Screens.
*   Going to bed worried or angry.
*   Medication - Many drugs, including asthma and cough meds, antihistamines, anticonvulsants, and stimulants disturb sleep.
*   Naps - Too much napping during the day can make it more difficult to fall asleep at night.
*   Caffeine in all forms too close to bedtime.
*   Alcohol, nicotine, and marijuana - These drugs have the initial effect of inducing sleepiness but the reverse effect when wearing off. 
*   Exercising too close to bedtime.
*   Changes to hormones.
*   Snoring.
*   Shift work - Shift workers are especially vulnerable to irregular sleep patterns, which leads to excessive sleepiness, reduced productivity, irritability, and mood problems. 
*   Stressful situations.
*   Eating too close to bedtime.
*   Jet lag.

Neutraceuticals that help with sleep (try one for several days to see if it works and take 30 minutes before bedtime):

*   Melatonin - 0.3 - 6 mg/day
*   5-HTP - 50 - 200 mg/day
*   Magnesium glycinate or citrate - 50 - 40 mg/day
*   GABA - 250 - 1,000 mg/day

**My Action Steps:**

*   I make sleep a top priority, which means I have to sacrifice many other things. 
*   Without question, the single most important component of my sleep is keeping a regular schedule. I go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, seven days a week. I do not use an alarm to wake up. This took work and consistency with habits, and it sucks when I stay up late because I will be awake at the same time regardless. Sleep is important enough that it's worth the sacrifice.
*   I keep the bedroom cool and use a water-cooled mattress pad called the OOLER to create a perfect sleep temperature. I keep the bedroom dark and ensure no noises.
*   I try to get sun exposure when the sun rises in the morning.
*   After the sun goes down, I use blue light filters on screens or wear blue-light blocking glasses if I will be staring at screens for an extended period of time.
*   I do not consume any caffeine past 2 PM.
*   I limit alcohol intake (if at all).
*   I do not consume any calories within 3 hours of bedtime.
*   I avoid naps during the day.
*   I take a magnesium supplement every day.
*   If my mind is racing, I will practice meditation. I probably should practice meditation every day regardless. 
*   Avoid anything stressful at bedtime.
