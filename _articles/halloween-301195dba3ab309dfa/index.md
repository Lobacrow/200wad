Halloween is nearly upon us. There is a potluck in the office tomorrow, and I will avoid it due to the low probability of food I should be eating. Maybe I will get some dark-chocolate-covered popcorn at the airport as my treat.

In Arizona, it's usually cool by the time Halloween rolls around but there are exceptions. A couple of years ago it was over 100 degrees. I was passing out chocolate candy bars that were melting, and I joked that this would reveal the razor blades. 

When I was a kid I remember the big scare about poisons or metal in candy. I think one year local hospitals offered free x-ray testing to verify that the candy was safe. I don't ever remember being deterred from eating said candy.

Nowadays, trick-or-treaters are more likely to be injured or killed due to an auto accident. I read an article stating that accidents involving pedestrians and cars are greatly increased on Halloween. 

A buddy of mine who lives alone was complaining about having to pass out candy on Halloween. I told him he could keep all his lights out or put a sign on his door. His idea for a sign was "CONVICTED SEX OFFENDER - PUBLIC POSTING REQUIRED." He has quite a sense of humor.
