In hotel parking lots it is very common to see open trunks and people adding or removing luggage. For the Brits I'm talking about the _boot_ of the car. 

A more unusual occurrence is seeing a car hood up. Again for the Brits, when I say car hood I'm talking about the car _bonnet_. I'll save my musings about the umbrella, otherwise known as a _bumbershoot_, for another post. Wow what's with the British slang today?? The next thing I'll be saying is I took the _lift_ up to the office to avoid falling _arse over tit_ down the stairs with my luggage.

Who lifts the car hood to check the oil or fill the washer fluid anymore? I bet not even mechanics do that with their own cars. By the way, you ever notice mechanics usually and ironically have the crappiest running cars? 

Nowadays, when you see a car hood up you know there's a problem. In Arizona we are just about due for news stories referring to "car-b-que's" in which car engines burst into flames due to overheating. Another reason the car hood is up may be someone pretending to have a problem. This may attract curious onlookers or good samaritans who will stop to help, get ambushed, and be knocked unconscious with a sock full of pennies. I guess this became a different kind of problem.
