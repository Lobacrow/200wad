I had an epiphany this afternoon with an idea for a newsletter. I have been thinking about starting a newsletter for awhile and making veiled threats here and there. I've decided it's time to take action.

The first challenge is narrowing down a topic. I write about a variety of topics, but in order to develop an audience for a newsletter, I want to focus on one topic.

The next challenge is figuring out where to start the newsletter and all the nuts and bolts that go into it. Fortunately, there are applications and services that handle all the behind-the-scenes machinery so I can focus solely on the writing. I'm tried of playing the game of pros and cons and spending hours analyzing which one to use. I picked one and started setting things up.

I'm going to launch tomorrow and then all will be revealed. Until then, I'll share the general topic I'll be writing about: health and wellness.

I've been exercising the writing muscle every day for a fairly long time. It's time to concentrate my effort and take things to the next level. Who knows how it's going to turn out. 

@keni talked about the final 100 days of the year and making them count. 

Here I go.

See you tomorrow.
