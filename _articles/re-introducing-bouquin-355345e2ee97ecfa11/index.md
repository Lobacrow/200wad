Bravisimo!!

I have no reservations calling this product launch what it is: a game-changer.

Baz has revealed to us a future path for electronic book writing, publication, distribution, and consumption. 

It's your books as web pages on any device. Indexed web pages--SEO anyone??

Easy for authors to publish. Easy for readers to purchase and consume. Integration with Stripe for minimal friction at the point of sale.

I'm still trying to process the full implications of this new product. Let me discuss one aspect that is perhaps most exciting to me. 

Book community features.

Picture reading articles on the web and then reading all the comments. Sometimes the comments are more entertaining/valuable than the article! Imagine this same functionality for a book. As a reader, imagine reading a book and having access to all the comments of the people who read the book before you. Imagine you have the ability to also contribute to the collective. As an author, imagine seeing all these comments and ideas in real-time. 

If there is any member of #Teamstreak who is writing a book or thinking about writing a book, the time is NOW. No more excuses. There is a wave swelling in the distance. Are you ready to ride it?
