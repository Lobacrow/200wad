I am woefully ignorant when it comes to nutrition. Anything I learned in health class in high school is certainly obsolete. I took Biology I and was so bored that I refused to continue to Biology II and some other course before finally getting to Human Anatomy and Physiology. I took all the chemistry and physics courses instead. In college, I was a math major, and I was certainly not learning proper nutrition from the dorm cafeterias and fast food places.

Only recently have I begun to learn about nutrition as part of Project Food As Fuel. Even then the focus has been on diabetes and the ketogenic diet. The universe tapped me on the shoulder recently, and it's time to take Project Food as Fuel to the next level.

There is a company called [Precision Nutrition](https://www.precisionnutrition.com/) that offers an online Level 1 Certification Program. This program was developed over fifteen years using data from over 100,000 clients and is considered to be an authority on the science of nutrition and the art of coaching. This program has open enrollment twice per year, and a new class is starting up.

Well, this is exactly what I have been looking for! This program uses cutting-edge research and real-life results to teach about nutrition. But even better, the second component is about coaching.

I have a background in education. I used to teach junior high students and tutored high school students. I have also been a corporate trainer. Teaching and training are about instructing knowledge and skills. Coaching is about changing behavior. Coaching is another gap in my expertise that I would like to fill.

Now, I could just find a health coach and learn that way. But who knows if the person I find is really any good. My strategy? I'm going to take the training a health coach would take and apply it to myself as my first client.Â 

Even better, at the end of the training after passing all the tests, I will receive a Precision Nutrition Level 1 Certification. This will allow me to be listed in the company's directory and will provide me with at least some level of credibility. Considering that my career and specialty is not in the health space, I have some catching up to do.

Of course, I will write about my new adventure here. Perhaps I will save the very best tidbits for #Teamstreak members only. I like that idea.
