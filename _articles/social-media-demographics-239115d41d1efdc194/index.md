I recently read an article with an infographic about the state of social media demographics in 2019. If you want to go straight to the source and skip my commentary, here is the [article](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/the-demographics-of-social-media-in-2019-infographic/559894/). The following are my takeaways.

**YouTube** is king - 73% of US adults use YouTube. This is not surprising. Everyone loves videos.

**Facebook** is a close second - 69% of US adults use Facebook. I would be happy to see this decline to teach Facebook a lesson about using and misusing personal data.

**Instagram** is big with the younger demographic - 76% of users aged 18-29 use it daily. If your industry is a visual one, this is the place to be.

**Pinterest** is big with women - 42% of women use it compared to 15% of men. This does not surprise me. I signed up just to get ideas for my dream board, but I did not feel the draw to remain engaged.

**LinkedIn** is for educated professionals - 27% of US adults use it, but those surveyed have annual incomes over $75,000 or college degrees. My experience is that LinkedIn is for people looking for jobs or people offering jobs. I guess people also like to share "industry news." I still don't get how appearing in five searches this week qualifies for a notification.

**Twitter** has fallen behind - Only 22% use Twitter. This is a surprising figure for all the attention it gets.
