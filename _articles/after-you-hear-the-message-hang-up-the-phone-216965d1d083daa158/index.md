I wouldn't be surprised if some people on 200WAD have never listened to a voicemail message, much less have used an answering machine. For people who DO remember listening to messages, perhaps you have experienced the following phenomenon.Â 

Have you noticed there is usually one or two key pieces of information in a message and that's all you need? It's usually a phone number or maybe a time for a meeting. People ramble on and on but you are listening for the key piece of information, and once you get it you are done with the message.

Personal development and motivational content can be addicting. There is always a new book or training course or podcast episode that you want to consume and extract every bit of wisdom. Sometimes you can get caught up in wanting the best strategies, being the most productive, and making the most effective use of your time. But at some point, it's time to stop learning and start doing.

Experience is a great teacher. Sure, you want to learn from other people's mistakes, but you can't let being overly cautious get in the way of rolling up your sleeves and getting to work.

After you hear the message, hang up the phone.
