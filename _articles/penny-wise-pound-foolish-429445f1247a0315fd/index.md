I just filled up the ol' car with gas. I don't pay attention to the price of gas anymore. The last time I actually paid attention to the price of gas was a few months ago in California when the price per gallon was approaching $5. Even then I just chuckled while sitting in the Uber.  

When the original iPhone was released in 2010, one of the "web-apps" that I used a lot was a gas price finder. I used it to find the cheapest gas, and I would drive out of my way just to make sure I got the cheapest price. Yes, I had the most expensive cell phone in the market and was driving around trying to save a penny or two per gallon on gas. Not anymore.

I have come to understand that time is more valuable than money. Sure, I don't want to waste money or pay more than I should for something. But now I draw the line.

The British saying, "Penny wise, pound foolish" is a good one. I take it to mean someone who wastes time saving a penny and missing the bigger picture. Eliminating satellite TV and saving over $100 per month--that's big picture. Worrying about $0.99/month for iCloud space, not big picture.

Some people might argue, "Yes, but those pennies add up." I call it the price of doing business. I'm not going to waste time focusing on the pennies.

The light switch for the porch light decided to stop working. It's not the original switch. After I moved into my house, I had an electrician replace the switch with one that had a timer. The theory is that I could program the porch light to come on in the evening and turn off in the morning, which creates an illusion that someone is home even when I was traveling. In practice, the timer was a pain to program because I had to change it periodically to accommodate changing daylight hours. Eventually, the timer switch just stopped working and wouldn't even allow me to turn the light on or off.Â 

I debated about replacing it myself. I got so far as to remove the cover and pulled the switch out and then realized this is not my thing. The extent of my electrical handiwork is to replace a light bulb or a 9-volt battery in a smoke detector. Sure, I could go to YouTube and watch videos, but it would take time and I'd need to get special tools.

I decided to hire a professional. He had it fixed in less than 30 minutes. While he was here, I had him also replace another ill-fated timer switch for the garage light. The service call was $125/hr, and he didn't even take that full time. It was worth it.

But wait, no more timer? I am using these fancy From Dusk Till Dawn (great movie) bulbs that have sensors that detect sunlight and turn on and off accordingly. No programming needed!
