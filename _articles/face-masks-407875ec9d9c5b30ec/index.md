I'm trying to figure out when face masks went from "suggested" to "strongly encouraged" to "mandatory." I had three appointments recently for which face masks were required. And by the way, you have to bring your own mask. If you don't have a mask, you're not allowed in! No masks are provided.

This is not how the world used to work. If you needed some required item, it was provided for you free of charge or for a nominal fee. Remember bowling alleys? If you didn't have bowling shoes, you could rent a pair for a small fee. If you do not have your own bowling ball, no problem you can use one of theirs.Â 

What's different about face masks? It appears to be the shortage that's the problem. Good luck trying to find some. You'd have a better chance of scoring some toilet paper.

I'm doing what I can to keep my immune system in tip-top shape so that when I encounter the novel coronavirus, I will hopefully deal with it asymptomatically. I'm not interested in a vaccine, and I'm certainly not interested in months or even years of tip-toeing around and living in fear.
