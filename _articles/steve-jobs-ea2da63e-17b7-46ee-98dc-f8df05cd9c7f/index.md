It's hard to believe that it's been 9 years since Steve Jobs died on October 5, 2011.Â 

I'm still an Apple fan, perhaps not as hardcore as I used to be. I don't have an Apple Watch anymore. I pushed my yearly iPhone upgrade cycle to every two years. This year I am due for an upgrade, but I'll admit I don't get as excited about new iPhones as I used to. I'm invested in the Apple ecosystem of iCloud and syncing data across devices as well as Apple Music.

Steve Jobs was one-of-a-kind, and you have take the good and the bad of his personality and behavior when assessing his impact on the world. For me, it's a net benefit because imagining a world without Macs and iPhones is a nightmare scenario even by 2020 standards.

Once a year I like to pause and reflect on the passing of Steve Jobs, and I usually share the story I wrote that sums up my Apple story. Much of it was written off-the-cuff as a eulogy to Steve Jobs the night he died, and I left all that unedited.
