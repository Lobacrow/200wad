We hardly think about breathing except when it becomes difficult. After climbing a couple of flights of stairs, I will suddenly have breathing at the top of my mind. Breathing is controlled by the autonomic nervous system, which regulates internal organs outside of conscious control. That doesn't mean you can't control your breathing to influence your emotions, chemicals, neurotransmitters, and hormones.

Deep, intentional breathing helps to regulate the autonomic nervous system and calms you down. This is especially helpful at bedtime when you are trying to wind down for a good night of sleep.

For those of you waiting with bated breath, here are three simple breathing methods to help you calm down, reduce stress, and get ready for a great night of sleep.

1.  **Box breathing** - This is a technique used by Navy SEALs designed to quiet the mind during periods of stress. Close your mouth and slowly inhale through your nose for four seconds, hold your breath for four seconds, exhale through your mouth for four seconds, then hold the exhalation for another four seconds. Repeat this technique for a few cycles to reach a relaxed state.
2.  **4-7-8 breathing** \- I first heard about this method from Dr. Andrew Weil who believes that this technique helps you get to sleep, reduces anxiety, helps to manage cravings, and helps to control or reduce anger responses. Place the tip of your tongue against the ridge of tissue behind your upper front teeth. Quietly inhale through the nose for four seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds, then exhale audibly through your mouth, making a whooshing sound, for eight seconds. Repeat the cycle at least three more times for a total of four breaths. Exhalation should take twice as long as inhalation. The absolute time you spend on each phase is not important; the ratio of 4:7:8 is important.
3.  **Alternate-nostril breathing** - This technique is practiced as part of Kundalini Yoga and is particularly effective at stress reduction. Gently press your thumb on your right nostril and gently breathe out through your left nostril. Next, gently breathe in through the left nostril, then press the left nostril closed with a different finger, remove your thumb from the right nostril and breathe out through the right nostril. Breathe in through the right nostril then close it off and breathe out through the left nostril. Repeat this technique of breathing out then in from one nostril at a time at least three more times.
