When you stop learning, your brain starts dying. 

This fact surprised me: You are more likely to develop a mental illness if you have an "old mindset." Examples of this are when you might say any of the following:

*   _I'm too old for that._
*   _I don't have the energy._
*   _I just want to be left alone._
*   _I'm going to die soon, so why bother changing my habits?_
*   _This is how I've done things for years, why change now?_ 

What are the things that accelerate aging that you should avoid?

*   Not learning anything new
*   Being in a job that does not require ongoing learning
*   high iron levels
*   smoking anything
*   alcohol or marijuana abuse
*   standard American diet
*   loneliness
*   lack of purpose

**My Action Steps**

*   A week ago I had blood drawn to check my numbers. I have had high iron in the past, and if it is high this time I will donate blood.
*   I will make it a point to learn something new at work every day.
*   I will drink alcohol rarely and in moderation.
*   I will continue time-restricted eating by fasting for at least 12 hours (but preferably 14-16 hours each day). 
*   I will continue to monitor my blood pressure, blood glucose, ketones, and how I feel to ensure that what I'm eating supports my health goals. 
*   I will force myself to overcome my tendency to be a lone wolf and seek out interactions with other people (as long as they're not all hunkered down avoiding Coronavirus). 
*   I will remember the fate of my father and how his sharp and brilliant mind wasted away due to dementia and diabetes.
