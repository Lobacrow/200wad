Time for a rant. Software updates generally suck.

Microsoft is the worst. There is nothing worse than when you are ready to sign out at the end of the day and you see the following:

Update and restart

Update and shut down

Sleep

How about Shut down now and Update the next time I boot up?? Just gives me more time for coffee. Don't waste my time at the end of the day when I'm ready to check out.

Even the venerable Apple is not immune from OS update tomfoolery. This morning I sat down at the iMac focused and ready to get some work done only to see the screen go black to install updates. This is why I don't like automatic updates. Isn't the point that you update automatically on your own time so that I don't have to worry about it? Instead, wait for me to sit down to get some work done and then give me a big stiff arm with an update. So automatic updates are now turned off on the iMac. I guess I need to control it after all.

The same applies with iPhone. I used to update iOS as soon as a new version was released. Not anymore. Apple has had a spotty track record with updates, and while I can exist without a computer for awhile, the iPhone must remain operational 100% of the time. So my strategy now is I wait for at least a week. Then I update the iPad first. Take it for a spin, make sure nothing goes wrong. Only then will I update the iPhone.
