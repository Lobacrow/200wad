This was my first time seeing a concert at the Hollywood Bowl. It is an unusual venue in that it's built inside of a hill. It has a capacity of 17,500, and I was one of the masses attending the sold-out show. Getting through security took a lot longer than seemed necessary. There was a giant mass of people converging upon eight metal detectors. Once I got in, there wasn't even time to get water. I heard the bagpipes, and I knew the show was starting. Rod was born in England but grew up in Scotland, which explains his affinity for the Scots including the Celtic football team.

As I was walking to my seat, Rod appeared on stage to open the show with _Infatuation_. That song always reminds me of the concert many years ago in which during that song I was able to shake Rod's hand when he ventured along the side of the stage to greet fans. 

It doesn't seem like Rod had his usual energy. Perhaps I was comparing his performance with that of the seemingly unending energy of Mick Jagger. But his voice was in fine form. Rod still looks the same, but I can't same the same of his band members. I've been going to these concerts so long that I notice how much older the bandmates are getting. 

He played the hits, including an unusual opening for [_Maggie May_](https://youtu.be/KCsGE1Cgv1k). @keni, of course, he played [Forever Young](https://youtu.be/q5R9hd9I0Ro). There were also a few surprises. It was the first time I had heard [_It Takes Two_](https://youtu.be/89BMrzAHxN4), originally recorded as a duet with Tina Turner. When Rod took a break, his back-up singers rendered a faithful rendition of Fleetwood Mac's _Go Your Own Way_. One noticeable absence: Rod did not kick autographed soccer balls into the audience. This is the first concert I can recall that he did not do this. 

I was surprised that Rod completed his set before bringing on Jeff Beck to perform only five additional songs. Jeff Beck is truly a virtuoso guitar player. I was mesmerized by what he was able to do with that guitar. I remember thinking, that guy is doing exactly what he should be doing. They completed [five songs](https://youtu.be/nE1Ho_F8lsk) and there was no encore. Another surprise. The concert felt short. I don't know why they only played five songs together. 

Considering the history between these two, this might be the last time they perform together. I'm glad I got to see them.
