If you are interested in blogging, you should know the name Jon Morrow. If you don't, [this is a good article](https://unstoppable.me/life-lessons/) to learn more about Jon's inspiring story and career.

Jon just released a new podcast called [Break Through the Noise](https://podtail.com/podcast/break-through-the-noise-with-jon-morrow/). In the episode called The 3 Biggest Lessons from Getting Over 200 Million Visitors, Jon stated the following:

> I once wrote 2,000 words a day every day for three years straight without stopping. Christmas morning, I woke up and I wrote my 2,000 words before I opened my presents. I was in a car accident, and I had them bring my laptop into the hospital so I could write my words. I had a freakish dedication to becoming a better writer.

I'm going to repeat this for emphasis.

_2,000 words a day every day for three years straight without stopping._

We all have different reasons for writing. I'm glad there are many people on 200WAD who are writing as a hobby. The more the merrier. But I want to narrow my focus to the people who want to take their writing to the next level. I'm talking to the people who have lofty goals and want writing to be the vehicle to make it all happen. As @jasonleow aptly put in his [recent post](https://200wordsaday.com/words/two-reasons-we-can-feel-bad-while-keeping-a-streak-we-should-care-about-one-of-them-321585de67c779ec8a), you need to have a deep "why" for writing. 

"I want to be a better writer." That's not good enough. Go deeper.

"I want to make money as a full-time writer." Okay, that's fine but if money is your primary goal, you've got a long and hard road ahead.

Time to go deeper. How deep? Allow me to demonstrate.

I set up a blog a year ago and didn't do much with it. I got as far as email capture and an about page and that's about it. I had a buddy of mine help me out, but the technological obstacles were in the way of what I really wanted to do--write. Writing is my way out of the Matrix.

I already have a job that is unfulfilling, stressful, and certainly not fun. If I have to spend 8-10-12 hours a day doing that, I am certainly not going to settle for drudgery or anything that feels like work in my free time. In fact, @keni asked me the other day how the book project is coming along. I was honest and said well it's slow in part because it started to feel like work. 

I enjoy the process of writing. If I had tried this experiment on my blog or even Medium, it would not have worked. Too many obstacles.

I made it to the penultimate post of my one-year anniversary on 200WAD. 

_Aside:_ Jack in the Box has the Ultimate Cheeseburger. I wonder if some fast food restaurant will introduce the Penultimate Cheeseburger. That's the one you eat on the way home before you eat the Ultimate Cheeseburger (with curly fries) while sitting on the couch in front of the TV.

What's next after nearly a year of writing every day? More on that tomorrow.
