In my current stage, I am not interested in reading or writing fiction. My usual catchphrase is "Who has time for fiction??" That said, when I come across content that I think will help others (even if it's not applicable to me) I want to share it.

In a recent [podcast episode](https://youtu.be/dw7ty_EFWJ8), James Altucher interviewed author Chuck Palahniuk. Chuck is perhaps most famous for the novel _Fight Club_, which was made into a movie starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton that has achieved cult classic status.

Chuck has a new book about writing called _Consider This: Moments in my writing life after which everything was different._ James said that this is the best book about writing that he's ever read. He is clearly a huge fan of Chuck's, but that should not take away from what appears to be a solid book about fiction writing.

This podcast episode definitely provides a lot of inside baseball about writing including character development, point of view, description, plot, flashbacks and flashforwards, and many other interesting discussions about authors, novels, and short story collections.

Listening to this episode made me wish I were into reading and writing fiction right now. I will certainly return to this discussion and Chuck's book in the future when I decide to switch gears. In the meantime, if writing fiction is your bag I would recommend a listen.
