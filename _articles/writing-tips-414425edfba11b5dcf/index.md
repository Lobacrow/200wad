If you do something long enough, sooner or later people will ask you for tips on how you do what you do. For example, @judetejada recently recommended writing as a topic for my podcast. This news may disappoint, but today I am not sharing any of my own writing tips. Do not despair, however, because today I am sharing an absolute gold mine for writers.

As it happens, I had a meeting with my financial advisor today, and he introduced me to a writer named David Perell. Without knowing anything about him, I am recommending his content based purely on this one article that summarizes his best advice about writing.

There is so much great wisdom about writing in this post! I don't care if you've been writing for a couple of days or a couple of years--you will find something of value here. 

My goal today is to convince you to take some time to read this article. Once you do, add a comment with something that spoke to you. This one is a gift that keeps on giving.

All right, enough commentary. Time for you to get to the good stuff.
