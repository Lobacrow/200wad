I was at Target a few days ago, and despite the numerous empty shelves and aisles, the magazine rack in the checkout lane was fully stocked. I will say _Time Magazine_ had my number. There were two _Time Magazine_ special editions right next to each other: _The Science of Sleep_ and _The Science of Nutrition_.

Magazines are a holdover from the past. I don't think they'll be around much longer. I wrote about that in [another post](https://medium.com/@brandonwilson_84606/6-reasons-why-magazines-are-going-out-like-powdered-wigs-13054ac13d03). So, even though I'm the last person who would be buying magazines, I purchased both of them.

_Time Magazine_ is about as mainstream as it gets. I want to see how mainstream media are communicating information about sleep. They've already used considerable resources to identify the topics and information, so I might as well leverage that as I refine the offerings in my upcoming book.

Here are the chapters:

*   Introduction: The Power of Sleep
*   What Sleep is For
*   Doctor Says: Back to Bed
*   Getting to Bedtime
*   Sleep and the Teenage Brain
*   Tuning Out Bad Dreams
*   Sleep Like a Pro
*   Animal Slumbers
*   The Truth About Sleeping Pills
*   How Low Can You Go?
*   Goodnight Gadgets
*   Wake Up to Your Creativity
*   The Graveyard Shift
*   Sleep Studies

This magazine is 96 pages and no ads! I will read the whole thing so you don't have to. I'll let you know if this changes any of the core structure of my book.
