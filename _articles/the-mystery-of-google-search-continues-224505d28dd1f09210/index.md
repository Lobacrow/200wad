In a [previous post](https://200wordsaday.com/words/medium-posts-160625cc758a037cfb) I wrote about articles I have written on Medium. I was puzzled then and continue to be puzzled by the behavior of one of my articles.  

Far and away the article that has received the most views (currently 74K) is my summary about selling books on Amazon. In fact, for the longest time if you searched for "Selling books on Amazon" on Google, my article showed up Page 1 often in the top three links. I don't want this to sound like bragging because I have no earthly idea how this article got this type of traffic.

Today I received my weekly stats for Medium articles and there was a drop-off in views. On average I have been getting somewhere between 3K to 5K reads per week for all Medium articles. This last week I had 332.  

The Amazon article has been averaging 300-400 views per day for months, and suddenly on July 2nd there was a steep drop-off to 20 views and it's been that low ever since. I went to search for my story on Google and now can't even find it, even if I Google the exact title.  

So the mystery deepens. I have no idea what changed. I emailed Medium Support to see if they have an answer. It was a good run while it lasted.
