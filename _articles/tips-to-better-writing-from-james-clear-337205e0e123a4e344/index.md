Many people on 200WAD are rabid fans of James Clear by way of his book _Atomic Habits_. I signed up for his email newsletter because my financial advisor recommended it as always providing actionable information. I know @jasonleow agrees. I'm just now catching up on previous newsletters and found a nice gem with tips to become a better writer.

\--write about what fascinates you \- If the topic is boring to you, it's going to be boring to your readers. Write about topics you find interesting and fascinating, and your enthusiasm and excitement will come through to your readers, especially if they find the topics equally fascinating.

\--make one point per sentence - I have a tendency to create run-on sentences. One point per sentence is a good target to shoot for. 

\--use stories to make your point \- When I first started writing, I tended toward the teaching approach. Do this then do this and you should do this. It's a much better strategy to use stories to make your point.

\--cut extra words like "really" and "very" - This is part of the editing process in which less is more. 

\--read the whole thing out loud - I learned this technique in high school. It's better to have someone else proofread your work, but at a minimum, you should read your piece out loud. Reciting your work allows you to catch the missing words your brain filled in that aren't actually there. It also helps you adjust the rhythm of your words and proper sentence length.

\--post publicly (you'll try harder when you know others will read it) - The tried and true method at 200WAD. 

\--be more thoughtful about what you consume. The quality of ideas you put in determines the quality of ideas you put out. Love this one! If someone is experiencing writer's block or in a slump, the first thing I want to know is what are they reading, watching, listening to.
