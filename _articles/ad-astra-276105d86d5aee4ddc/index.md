I rarely go to see movies opening weekend. It turns out, it's not really the madhouse I expected if it's not some blockbuster. Maybe it's because I saw it at an IMAX theater. The movie is called _Ad Astra_ starring Brad Pitt. 

I like space movies. Most recently I watched _First Man_, starring Ryan Gosling who portrayed Neil Armstrong as he set foot on the moon. I really enjoyed _The Martian_ with Matt Damon stranded on Mars. _Interstellar_ had some cool parts but was overall just weird. _Gravity_ with Sandra Bullock was great in IMAX because you really had the sensation of floating in space.

_Ad Astra_ is not your typical space movie. It's really a movie about relationships, especially between a father and son, that happens to be set in the future when space travel has become as perfunctory as air travel is today. I enjoyed the movie mainly because Brad Pitt carries it with his superb acting. 

The movie is not action-packed. It is rather slow, but I think that suits the subject matter. If you are expecting a romping space adventure, this is not the movie for you. If you are interested in a thoughtful piece about human emotions with space as the setting, perhaps you might enjoy it.
