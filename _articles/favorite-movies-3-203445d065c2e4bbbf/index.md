@Rawhead inspired me to write about this movie next because of his reference to the great Robin Williams.

When I used to flip through channels, if this movie was on I had to start watching it no matter what part it was on. At its core, there is just something funny about a man dressing up as a woman. I'm not disrespecting crossdressers, transvestites, or any of the like. I'm merely pointing out my kind of humor.

Of course the movie is _Mrs. Doubtfire_. which was released in 1993. Robin Williams portrays a recently-divorced dad so desperate to spend more time with his kids that he concocts a scheme to dress up as an English housekeeper. He has run-ins with his ex-wife's new love interest and a social worker tasked with verifying that he has an appropriate home environment. Toward the end of the movie, he has a fateful night at a restaurant where simultaneously the charade falls apart and he somehow lands a new job.

The movie was the second-highest-grossing movie of 1993, second to _Jurassic Park,_ and also won both an Academy Award and Golden Globe Awards.

Now that Robin Williams is gone, it feels different to watch the movie. I still enjoy it and laugh every time I watch it. But there is an underlying sad note as I think about the loss of such a gifted comedian and actor.
