I completed my SQL course on Saturday. I used the Join.me software and recorded every session. Some of the videos are 1.5 hours in length. 

I attempted to upload the videos to my company's SharePoint site and ran into a limitation of file size. The first video is under 100 MB and uploaded fine. The second video is 206 MB and could not be uploaded due to file size.

My thinking is that I need to split the video into two parts. I tried using the default video editor with Windows 10, and that was a waste of time. I never did figure out how to export the separate videos. I then downloaded a free piece of software that actually worked except with another problem. The original mp4 file was 206 MB. I split this file right down the middle into two videos and exported each one in the same mp4 format. Somehow, part 1 is 279 MB and part 2 is 286 MB!? I don't understand how it's possible that I split a video in half, and each half is somehow bigger than the original file. 

By the way, an mp4 is already compressed so sending to zip files buys me nothing. I even tried splitting the video with iMovie on my Mac and had a similar bloated file size issue. Can anyone explain what's going on here and offer a solution?
