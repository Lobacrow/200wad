Today I am flying to Los Angeles for another "Power Weekend." I call it a Power Weekend because it is a weekend of training and personal development. The last Power Weekend was at the [end of January in Birmingham](https://200wordsaday.com/words/power-weekend-57635c4c534015adb). 

The cycle is four events each year, and this is the last one of the cycle. All the other major events take place more than once in various countries throughout the world. This final event is the only one in the world. Anyone who wants to attend this event needs to come to the US. This is why the event is called United.

So, my weekend is planned. What about yours? Do you have the typical schedule of work during the week and then weekends wide open? Maybe you don't have the typical work schedule and so Saturday and Sunday are no different than the other days of the week.

Weekends should not be wasted. Unless you work on weekends, it is valuable free time for you to accomplish many things. But you have to plan your weekend before the weekend. 

How many times have you thought about all the things you planned to do on a weekend, then Sunday night realized you just wasted time and didn't accomplish much of anything? We all need to recharge every once in awhile, so I am not saying every weekend needs to be planned to the minute and full of activity. 

Consider planning the weekend before the weekend. If you want to start out small, pick one weekend each month and make it your own "Power Weekend." Attend a training event or seminar. Volunteer. Tackle some of the projects that you've been procrastinating about. Make a commitment to take some actions that are going to move you forward in some areas of your life. This investment will pay off.
