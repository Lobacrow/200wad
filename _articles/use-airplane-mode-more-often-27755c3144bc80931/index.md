I used to only use airplane mode on my phone for the intended purpose. Now, I use it all the time, and it has helped me stay focused and eliminate distractions.

\--**At bedtime** - Due to my work schedule and changes in time zones I was going to sleep earlier than most people. Setting airplane mode at bedtime enabled me to avoid notifications that might draw me back into using the phone instead of getting to sleep. There is also the added benefit of eliminating exposure to EMF signals during the night.

\--**During my morning routine** - This is something new I'm trying this year. Rather than check my phone as soon as I wake up, I leave it in airplane mode. I then complete all the steps of my morning routine and only then do I take airplane mode off. Yes, this is tough. It gets easier the more you do it. I get a better start to the day when I can focus on my routine of exercise, meditation, and journaling.

\--**While driving** - iPhones now have a do-not-disturb feature that activates when it detects that you are driving. Prior to this, I put my phone in airplane mode to avoid distractions. There are WAY too many people of all ages staring at phones out on the road.

\--**When I need to focus** - Sometimes you have to force yourself to focus on specific tasks, especially when they are tasks you really don't want to do anyway. The phone is an easy out. When I put it in airplane mode there is nothing to see. It is one less distraction to worry about so I can focus and get my tasks completed.

Getting in the habit of strategically using airplane mode has helped me stay focused and eliminate distractions. I highly recommend this strategy.
