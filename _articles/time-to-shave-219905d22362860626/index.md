It's that time again. I have been home two weeks and developed quite the scraggly beard (with some white hairs popping up no less). I generally do not shave when I am home. For those who missed it, I detailed my shaving regimen [here](https://200wordsaday.com/words/my-shaving-regimen-145075caea4ce79dcd). This is not a simple task by design and certainly not meant for daily completion.Â 

I am traveling to California today, so it's time to shave. Part of the Consultant's Code is to look presentable in the office.

Today's shave is different because as I was adding a new blade to my safety razor, the head that holds the blade broke. The threaded stem on the head broke off inside the shaft rendering both parts useless. So much for a lifetime warranty. I've had this razor for maybe 3-4 years. I purchased it at The Art of Shaving. Perhaps I will take it in when I return home and see whether they will offer a replacement. If not, this is a good time to re-evaluate my shaving tools and make sure I'm using the best instruments on my face.

By the way, I did find a new pair of shoes based on my previous foot issues outlined in [this post](https://200wordsaday.com/words/feet-and-proper-shoes-195285cf938b421215). I am road-testing them this week and will report my results.
