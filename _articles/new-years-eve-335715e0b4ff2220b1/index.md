I am resolved to not have resolutions for the new year. There will also be no summary of 2019. I like @arcticloon 's approach--If you want to know what I was up to in 2019, there are 364 posts you can read. 

I can't remember the last time I actually stayed up until midnight for New Year's Eve. Partying until all hours of the night is a young person's game. Also, for some reason in the US, New York is considered THE place for celebration. Any other part of the country in a different timezone is somehow not as significant. Fine by me. 

I'm still on the East Coast, so there is an outside chance I'll be awake at midnight even though that would be detrimental to my sleep regimen. Most people will be celebrating tonight with some sort of ethanol, which is going to further compromise sleep. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if New Year's Eve is statistically one of the worst nights of sleep for most people. 

Awhile back, I learned the cycles of how people operate. During November and December, people take lots of time off work for vacations and spending time with family. After January 1st it's supposed to be business as usual, but now the next cycle begins: SICK! People are supposed to be getting back to work, but instead, some are going to be using those fresh PTO hours to call out sick. These people probably dread the usual reset of deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums for health insurance.

But did you expect anything else from all that bad eating and sleeping the last couple weeks?
